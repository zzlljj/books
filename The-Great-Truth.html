<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>INTRODUCTION</span></h1>
<p class="font7">When we are fortunate enough to achieve success and happiness in life, we seldom pay attention to spiritual beings such as deities or God. However, when we faces unsolvable obstacles in life,&nbsp;most of us seek out holy beings to ask for help. Why do we do this? It‘s because we have no&nbsp;another way. After all, when we come to holy beings, we usually do so for personal benefit. In&nbsp;reality, whether our requests are responded to by these holy beings or not is still debatable.&nbsp;Moreover, we have not determined if God exists for real; therefore, our belief in God also vague.&nbsp;But if God is real, what is the nature of the relationship between God and humans? Is God&nbsp;willing to help us or not? And if He is, how will He do it?</p>
<p><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font7">I have personally been through many ups and downs in my life. I used to pray to holy deity for help when I face difficulties in life. Through those experiences, I realized that holy beings are&nbsp;real; however, they have their own principles in responding to humans‘ entreaties. Even when I&nbsp;worshipped them with all respect, I couldn‘t change their decisions. Thus, I tried my best to find&nbsp;out the truth about their principles and prove their existence scientifically. I hope that in this&nbsp;book you and I will be companions in our search for the truth.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 1</span></h1>
<h1><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>THE BIG QUESTIONS OF HUMANKIND</span></h1>
<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>1. The Theory of Evolution and the Origin of Humans</span></h2>
<p class="font7">Where do your beliefs lie? If you are an atheist, you likely believe in the Theory of Evolution as put forth by Charles Robert Darwin. Can you explain how the first single-celled organisms&nbsp;appeared on the Earth? Can you explain how those single-celled organisms later turned into&nbsp;multi-celled organisms, how multi-celled organisms became reptiles, and how reptiles changed&nbsp;into mammals? How do you explain why monkeys evolved into humans, and yet humans are so&nbsp;much more intelligent than monkeys?</p>
<p class="font7">Do you believe that Africa is the cradle of humankind? If you do, how do you explain that the first humans were black, but that today there are white, yellow, brown, and red-skinned people?&nbsp;If you believe that after humans migrated out of Africa, climate conditions and the environment&nbsp;formed different races, then how do you explain the following cases?</p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">Two countries, Algeria and Mali, are both in Africa and share a border, but Malians are&nbsp;black and Algerians are white.</span></p></li><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">Similarly, Libyan people and Nigerian people belong to two different races and have&nbsp;different skin colors. Egyptian people and Sudanese people also belong to two different race&nbsp;and have different skin colors.</span></p></li><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">Russia and Mongolia are next to each other, but the Russians belong to the white-skinned&nbsp;race and Mongolians belong to the yellow-skinned race.</span></p></li><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">China is adjacent to Kazakhstan, but Chinese people have yellow skin while Kazakhstani&nbsp;people have white skin.</span></p></li></ul>
<p class="font7">How do you explain why ancient people, after leaving Africa, did not choose Asia or Europe as a place to settle down, but rather traveled, with great hardship, through mountains and streams,&nbsp;across deserts and oceans, to remote Australia? And how could the ancient humans know that the&nbsp;continent of Australia even existed, such that they went straight there?</p>
<p class="font7">Can you explain why ancient humans, after leaving Africa, left their mother tongue behind and created numerous languages? This phenomenon did not occur in recent centuries when British&nbsp;people went to Australia, when Spanish people migrated to Mexico, or when French people&nbsp;migrated to Canada. They neither adopted the local language nor created a new one; instead, they&nbsp;maintained use of their mother tongue and found ways to make it become the primary language&nbsp;in their new homes.</p>
<p class="font7">In recent decades, a number of people from different nations such as Vietnam, Japan, Korea, and China settled in the United States, with families spanning multiple generations. Although they&nbsp;use English in social communication, they still communicate in their mother tongues within their&nbsp;own communities and families. Moreover, they love, maintain, and teach their offspring the&nbsp;mother tongue from generation to generation. Meanwhile, we all know that, even with today‘s&nbsp;advanced civilization, creating a new language is not easy at all. So how could ancient people do&nbsp;so, and with such ease?</p>
<p class="font7">If you don‘t have explanations for these matters, you will find satisfying answers in the next chapters.</p>
<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>2. Issues Related to Spirit and the Human Brain</span></h2>
<p class="font7">Which schools of thought do you follow? Whether you are an idealist or a materialist, you must have at least once in your life witnessed or heard about psychic phenomena such as prophecies,&nbsp;telepathy, channeling, speaking in tongues, etc.</p>
<p class="font7">Do you know why a prophet can foretell someone‘s future, or the future events of a country or the world? Do you know why a psychic can tell someone‘s past accurately, tell what‘s happening&nbsp;inside the earth, or see far-away places?</p>
<p class="font7">Do you know why a medium, when channeling a spirit of the dead, can tell stories he or she has never heard or known before, or why he or she can speak a strange language or even cure sick&nbsp;people with water or leaves and make them well again?</p>
<p class="font7">In addition to psychic phenomena, do you have any idea why a prodigy of only a few years of age who has not yet acquired sufficient education can use a number of different languages&nbsp;fluently? Or why another prodigy is able to solve very complicated equations or problems of&nbsp;higher mathematics that even adults cannot solve?</p>
<p class="font7">The origin of prodigies‘ knowledge and the spiritual phenomena mentioned above will be explained to your satisfaction in the coming chapters.</p>
<h2><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>3. Ancient Architectural Works and Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs)</span></h2>
<p class="font7">Do you believe that ancient humans constructed great ancient architectural works such as the Giza pyramid in Egypt, Stonehenge in England, and Tiwanaku site in Bolivia? If you do, can you&nbsp;explain how they constructed those great architectural sites with only the simple and primitive&nbsp;tools of their era?</p>
<p class="font7">Do you believe that aliens are real? If you do, what do you think about them? Do you believe that they come to our Earth with good or bad intentions? Do you know why aliens create&nbsp;mysterious crop circles in fields? Do you know what energy they use to operate unidentified&nbsp;flying objects (UFOs)? Do you know why UFOs often appear in places when natural disasters&nbsp;are happening on Earth? For instance:</p>
<p class="font1">• <span class="font7">A UFO appeared in the dual disaster of the earthquake and tsunami on 03/11/2011 in Japan.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">A UFO appeared in the terrible dust storm that swept Mesa, Arizona (USA) on&nbsp;07/06/2011.</span></p></li><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">A UFO appeared during Hurricane Irene on 08/28/2011in New York.</span></p></li></ul>
<p class="font7">Information about phenomena such as those mentioned above are posted on many Internet sites and have garnered attention from many people, but no one can really explain these phenomena.&nbsp;However, all will be explained in the following chapters.</p>
<h2><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>4. Unexplained Issues Related to Religion</span></h2>
<p class="font7">Do you follow a particular religion? If you are a Buddhist, do you believe in reincarnation and karma? If you do, do you believe that souls, in the afterlife, remain alive and experience&nbsp;consciousness? How are those souls reincarnated in humans? Is the incarnation process directed&nbsp;by a sacred being? Doctrines of Buddhism say that, after achieving holiness, you will attain&nbsp;nirvana. What and where do you think nirvana is? Once people go there, how will they live?</p>
<p class="font7">If you are a Christian, a Muslim, or a Jew, what do you think about God‘s existence? Does God have a physical body? If you believe that God created humans and life on Earth, can you explain&nbsp;how He did that? Can you explain why God unreasonably punishes the entirety of humankind for&nbsp;the sin Adam and Eve committed?</p>
<p><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font7">Can you explain why God has a fate for each person? Some are happy, rich, and powerful while others are poor, miserable, or disabled. According to certain religions, God created all humans&nbsp;equal—so why does God impose inequality upon humans when it comes to fate? There are&nbsp;numerous shortcomings and related questions, and it would take quite some time to list them all.&nbsp;By the time you finish this book, you will have a much deeper understanding of many matters&nbsp;related to God and humans—clearly and scientifically.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 2</span></h1>
<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>THE UNIVERSE, GOD AND HUMANS</span></h1>
<h2><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>1. The Origin of the Universe and God</span></h2>
<p class="font7">Since ancient times, God has always been our greatest interest and is also the most controversial topic for mankind.</p>
<p class="font7">Does God really exist? How is God related to us? These questions have been asked for thousands of years, and yet God still remains a mystery. Although our understanding of God is not clear,&nbsp;many people still worship God wholeheartedly.</p>
<p class="font7">God is also called by different names, such as the Lord, Allah, Jehovah, Great Master, or supernatural being, etc. In reality, not only followers of religions such as Christianity or Islam&nbsp;worship God; non-religious people also worship their own versions of a supernatural being,&nbsp;which is another way to connect to God.</p>
<p class="font7">Faith via religion or via any conception of a supernatural being was formed in ancient times in the form of folk beliefs and has lived in the hearts of people throughout human history.</p>
<p class="font7">Most people connect to God only by faith—not by understanding or experience. If we only rely on the scriptures of the various religions to understand God and his works, we may never fully&nbsp;understand God. Unless we use science as the primary means to interpret everything logically,&nbsp;we won‘t really understand God. Besides science, there‘s no other way for us to find out the&nbsp;whole truth about God.</p>
<h3><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Science is the only way to find God—it is the key to opening the gate of heaven.</span></h3>
<p class="font7">As we know, humans have always searched for the truth about God, and yet it seems that all of our efforts have been thwarted by various obstacles. The main reason is the separation: each&nbsp;group finds their own direction, and follows paths of outdated concepts and prejudices. But&nbsp;everyone thinks that their own reasoning is correct, which makes the search for answers even&nbsp;more difficult. Let’s visualize this via the meaning of the phrase <span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“That bat, bai tan.” </span><span class="font7">The&nbsp;meaning of each word is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">That</span><span class="font7">= failure, loss</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Bat</span><span class="font7">= not, no more</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Bai</span><span class="font7">= defeated, failure</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Tan</span><span class="font7">= separated, disappear</span></p>
<p class="font7">Each word by itself carries a negative meaning, but when we put them together the phrase has a very positive meaning: <span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“No more loss, failure is defeated.” </span><span class="font7">It is understood that the dismal&nbsp;period of our lives have gone and good things await us ahead.</span></p>
<p class="font7">Similarly, the image of God in each isolated field of study is not always a heartening one:</p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">God in religion is mysterious and not easy to understand</span></p></li><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">The role of God in science is not yet acknowledged</span></p></li><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">The power of God in spiritual phenomena is unclear</span></p></li><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">UFOs and aliens elicit a threatening feeling rather than a positive one, and the perception&nbsp;is that this phenomenon is unrelated to God.</span></p></li></ul>
<p class="font7">But when combining the information from religions, science, spirituality, and ancient architectural works with UFO phenomena, we can decode the image and the role of God in the&nbsp;lives of humans.</p>
<p class="font7">Some religions maintain the view that God created the universe, but they only rely on their religious doctrines to accept it without scientific proofs. Apart from that, they cannot point to any&nbsp;new evidence to confirm their views, and therefore they cannot convince everyone, especially&nbsp;scientists.</p>
<p class="font7">Overall, we acknowledge an important difference between religion and science: religion seldom changes, while science is continually developing and moving forward. Science may prove the&nbsp;formation of the universe and the solar system; it may even determine the age of the universe,&nbsp;Earth, sun, and moon, etc. Science may prove the origin of humans who evolved from&nbsp;chimpanzees, and may result in many other important discoveries. But these things were formed&nbsp;in the past, and science today can only understand the cause and components of this formation. It&nbsp;cannot tell us exactly how things were originally formed. Whether things were formed by nature&nbsp;or created by God, they would still appear the same to our eyes today. Therefore, we can‘t&nbsp;illuminate God‘s role in the creation of many things existing in the universe and on Earth. Much&nbsp;of what we know about God is from the religious scriptures. These scriptures were written to&nbsp;form religions; they all carry important messages. These scriptures include the Old Testament&nbsp;and New Testament of Christianity, the Qur‘an of Islam, Buddhist teachings, and many other&nbsp;scriptures from various religions.</p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Science without religion is lame. Religion without science is blind” — Albert</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Einstein.</span></p>
<p class="font7">On the other hand, if the viewpoints of religions changed, this would introduce an unnecessary divergence of information. Religious scriptures have important clues for science to interpret, and&nbsp;often lead to the truth. But these days, we realize that our efforts have not gotten us anywhere.&nbsp;Let‘s continue to visualize the work that humans are pursuing via the story <span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Treasure Finders”&nbsp;</span><span class="font7">below.</span></p>
<p class="font7">When going out to look for treasure, each man brings with him a map hoping that he will be the first to find the treasure. But after a long time, no one finds it because each man‘s map contains&nbsp;only a part of the entire picture. Nobody realizes that the map they own is only a small piece of&nbsp;the complete guide to the treasure. The treasure can only be found when all the pieces of the&nbsp;puzzle are put together in an orderly sequence.</p>
<p class="font7">Following this analogy, our search process needs to begin with interpreting matters in different areas that are happening at the present and tracing them back in time, connecting various pieces&nbsp;of information together to determine the causes of these matters. Correctly doing so will give us&nbsp;clues to how things transpired in the past, and from there we can foresee the future. First and&nbsp;foremost, we need to analyze the following phenomena: prophecy, telepathy, mind control,&nbsp;speaking in tongues, and child prodigies.</p>
<p class="font7">A prophet is a person with the ability to know what will happen in the future. But we know that the prophet himself doesn‘t know the future. Therefore, it could be that someone else has&nbsp;implanted the information into the prophet‘s brain, and the information must therefore be&nbsp;transmitted by some type of signal wave that the prophet‘s brain can receive and be aware of the&nbsp;messages. But if someone wanted to generate this wave to transmit information, they would also&nbsp;need to use superior scientific equipment to make it happen. Through the above interpretation,&nbsp;we realize that whoever sent the messages must live in a physical body, since they know how to&nbsp;use materials to build and operate that equipment. But we know that the information received by&nbsp;the prophet is not sent by humans on Earth, as humans don‘t have the ability to know the future.&nbsp;Thus, we can conclude that it is done by extraterrestrial beings (aliens) from outer space. On the&nbsp;other hand, the prophets say that the messages they received are from sacred sources or angels.&nbsp;Consequently, aliens are angels. Back in the history, we can infer that the angels used waves to&nbsp;transmit messages to the prophet Mohammad, who created the Qur‘an, and they also transmitted&nbsp;messages to some Vietnamese people to create Caodaism. Furthermore, the scriptures of these&nbsp;religions always mention God as the supreme power. Thus, we can conclude that God is the&nbsp;leader of the angels, and that the angels use superior scientific equipment to communicate with&nbsp;humans. Therefore, God and the angels live in physical bodies, reside on a planet somewhere in&nbsp;the universe, and possess a very advanced civilization.</p>
<h3><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>God -&gt; Angels -&gt; Human beings</span></h3>
<p class="font7">We also find clues in UFO phenomenon and mysterious crop circles in fields around the world. But we first need to understand whether or not these phenomena are related to God and humans.&nbsp;Also, what do UFOs come to Earth for? In case you are thinking that aliens from outer space&nbsp;come to Earth with the intent to invade, it does not make sense, for the following reasons:</p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">There have been records of UFOs since ancient times. In recent decades, UFOs have&nbsp;appeared more frequently. But we haven‘t seen any evidence that aliens intend to harm&nbsp;humans and our Earth.</span></p></li><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">We recognize that their civilization is far more advanced than ours. Thus, if they wanted&nbsp;to invade the Earth, they could do it at any time—they wouldn‘t have to wait until humans&nbsp;become more civilized.</span></p></li></ul>
<p class="font1">• <span class="font7">If they don‘t have any relationship with humans and don‘t have good intentions toward us, they would not spend time attending to catastrophes on Earth. Remember, they&nbsp;specifically sent UFOs to places where catastrophes were happening.</span></p>
<p class="font7">Other important information about aliens is revealed in mysterious crop circles created in fields. Below are some crop circles expressing typical messages.</p><img src="The-Great-Truth_files/The-Great-Truth-2.jpg" style="width:226pt;height:318pt;"/>

<p class="font7">Message in picture 13c: The message broadcasted to space from Arecibo Radio Telescope by scientist Frank Drake on Nov 15, 1974.</p>
<p class="font7">Message in picture 13b: Aliens created this on the field near Chilbolton Observatory, Hampshire, UK on Aug 18, 2001.</p>
<p class="font7">Message in picture 13a: Comparison between two civilizations shows that there are basic differences between them in various aspects.</p>
<p class="font7">These messages reveal that aliens have a close relationship with humans, evidenced by the fact that they sent messages about our civilization and our religions.</p>
<p class="font7">In addition, we have other evidence related to aliens. This pertains to the architectural and scientific works that remain from ancient times. With the technology available during those&nbsp;times, the construction of great ancient architectural works such as Egyptian pyramids, stone&nbsp;statues on Easter Island, and Stonehenge in England was simply not possible. But many people&nbsp;still think that those edifices were built by humans alone.</p>
<p class="font7">How about 17 nuclear reactors in Oklo, Gabon, which were constructed almost two billion years before humans existed? Why is it that we can‘t accept that this construction and other great&nbsp;ancient works were built by aliens under God‘s supervision?</p>
<p class="font7">Connecting the above information together helps us to affirm that aliens used UFOs to reach Earth long before humans existed. They built nuclear power plants and architectural sites to&nbsp;reside while creating life on Earth. In recent years, they have returned and formed many crop&nbsp;circles in fields, sending us messages to help us better understand them. Once we understand&nbsp;their intent, we can recognize their leader. They are angels and their leader is God.</p>
<p class="font7">Besides, to get to know God more clearly, we should turn to His own words. They are expressed in the Bible, in the Old Testament, Book of Genesis section, Chapter 1.</p>
<p class="font7">Verse 26: Then God said, —Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, over all the&nbsp;Earth...&quot;</p>
<p class="font7">Verse 27: So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created.</p>
<p class="font7">In verse 26, when God said —let us,” He was talking to his colleagues, the angels. Then He said —make man in our image, according to our likeness,” and in verse 27, —So God created mankind&nbsp;in his own image.” This means that He asked the angels to create humans with an appearance&nbsp;similar to His. If God exists only with His invisible spirit, he wouldn‘t mention his —image” and&nbsp;ask the angels to make man according to His likeness, would he? Therefore, we shouldn‘t insist&nbsp;that God and the angles are spiritually invisible; apparently, God and the angels have physical&nbsp;bodies like us.</p>
<p class="font7">Once we define God as an intellectual being in a physical body, we can no longer assume that God is the creator of the universe, because before the universe was formed, there was no life at&nbsp;all, not even God. But a number of religions view God as the creator of the universe. Let us find&nbsp;out whether God really created the universe, or whether it was formed by nature.</p>
<p class="font7">The first words in the book of Genesis are, —In the beginning, God created the heaven and the Earth.” These words were written in an ancient era, and remember that the words in scripture&nbsp;were very simple so that the ancient people could understand. But with our knowledge of the&nbsp;universe today, —heaven and the Earth” can mean the sun and Earth, not necessarily the entire&nbsp;universe.</p>
<p class="font7">To determine whether God was the Creator of the universe or not, we can rely on another source of information with origins in Taoism. It was Lao Tzu who wrote this in Tao Te Ching. The last&nbsp;four lines in chapter 25 of Tao Te Ching say:</p>
<p class="font7">Man follows the Earth.</p>
<p class="font7">Earth follows heaven.</p>
<p class="font7">The universe follows the Tao.</p>
<p class="font7">The Tao follows only itself.</p>
<p class="font7">These lines can be understood to mean:</p>
<p class="font7">Man is created from Earth.</p>
<p class="font7">Earth is created from the universe.</p>
<p class="font7">The universe is created from Tao.</p>
<p class="font7">And Tao is created from nature.</p>
<p class="font7">Or:</p>
<p class="font7">Man imitates the Earth.</p>
<p class="font7">Earth imitates the universe.</p>
<p class="font7">The universe imitates Tao.</p>
<p class="font7">And Tao imitates nature.</p>
<p class="font7">The main factors in these lines are understood as follows: —man” refers to humans, —Earth” is the Earth, and —Tao” is the universe and nature. Reading the lines backwards, we understand that:&nbsp;nature created the universe, the universe created God, God created the Earth, and the Earth&nbsp;created man. In summary, nature itself created the universe; God was not the creator of the&nbsp;universe.</p>
<p class="font7">After the universe was formed, God was the first and the only life form that existed. He learned from the natural laws of the universe, and then He created the first angels who then live on the&nbsp;same planet. From there, He came up with the divine plan—creating new lives in the universe.&nbsp;After the plan was formed, God and the angels used their supreme knowledge and superior&nbsp;scientific equipment to create new solar systems and have them work according to the natural&nbsp;laws. From there, God created lives on selected planets and created humans according to his&nbsp;likeness, guiding them to evolve. As time passes, he continues to develop many lives throughout&nbsp;the entire universe, guiding them to salvation. The lives that have been liberated will help God to&nbsp;guide other lives that have not yet liberated.</p>
<h2><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>2. Origin of the Solar System and Origin of Life</span></h2>
<p class="font7">Although God is not the creator of the universe, God created a part of the universe. The whole solar system was created by God and the angels. After God created the Sun and the planets&nbsp;(including Earth), he continuously observed and adjusted for it to work accurately and&nbsp;harmoniously with the natural laws of the universe. God adjusted weight and volume and created&nbsp;satellites for the planets to acquire the precise distance, orbit and speed in order to maintain life&nbsp;on Earth.</p>
<p class="font7">Regarding the formation of the moon, science proved that the moon was formed from a volume of mass shot from the Earth after a crash with a huge meteorite in the Pacific Ocean. In the Old&nbsp;Testament, there is a phrase describing how God created Adam and Eve similar to the way the&nbsp;moon was formed from the Earth.</p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font7">1. The Earth existed before the moon; Adam came before Eve.</p></li><li>
<p class="font7">2. The moon was formed from material of Earth‘s side, Eve was created from Adam‘s rib.</p></li><li>
<p class="font7">3. The moon is a symbol of a beautiful woman in the legends of the peoples around the&nbsp;world; Eve is the symbol of a woman.</p></li><li>
<p class="font7">4. Earth and the moon must always coexist in order to maintain life on Earth; the verse&nbsp;—man leaves his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one&nbsp;flesh” (Genesis, 2:24) means the Earth was formed from the materials of the Sun and orbit&nbsp;together with the moon as one.</p></li></ul>
<p class="font7">Besides the similarities between the moon and a woman, the gravitational attraction of the moon also has an impact on women‘s menstrual cycles. Therefore, we can say that the story of Adam&nbsp;and Eve in the book of Genesis is the story of the Earth and the moon, not that Adam and Eve&nbsp;were the first humans on Earth.</p>
<p class="font7">After God realized that the solar system was running well, he sent angels to the Earth by UFOs. Angels created the water, atmosphere and constructed sites such as nuclear electric plants at&nbsp;Gabon and other architectural works to reside and work on Earth. Until God and the angels&nbsp;recognized that the Earth‘s climate was stable enough to begin life, God had the angels bring the&nbsp;genetic material of flora and fauna to the Earth, reproduced and then introduced them to the&nbsp;environment so that they could self-adapt and self-evolve.</p>
<p class="font7">Most of the existing lives on Earth were brought from outside of Earth by God and the angels and then crossbred and multiplied. All living species, from simple to complex, have different&nbsp;gene structures. Depending on the stability of Earth‘s climate and appropriate timeline, God&nbsp;released different species. In the early days, the angels only brought to Earth the genes of&nbsp;botanical species for plants in the forest, later they brought plants for grains, fruits, and&nbsp;vegetables. Similarly, the angels first brought to Earth animals with simple gene structures such&nbsp;as jelly fishes, later they brought animals with more complex gene structures such as reptiles and&nbsp;mammals.</p>
<p class="font7">All species must go through the process of evolution to self-adapt and improve in the Earth‘s environment. Evolution is a necessary process for all lives. However, weeds cannot evolve up&nbsp;into wheat, insects cannot evolve into mammals. Each species has a different genetic structure.&nbsp;All the botanical and animal species carry genetic information of their own kind. Genes contain&nbsp;information for physical, intellectual and sentient characteristics and will be inherited by the next&nbsp;generation. But not all species have souls; this is reserved for humans. All non-human species&nbsp;were created and evolved by the way described above. Let‘s find out if humans were evolved&nbsp;from chimpanzees. If true, how did this evolution happen? Was God involved this process?</p>
<p class="font7">To fully understand this matter, let‘s try to align the similarity between science and the Bible. According to scientists, humans evolved from chimpanzees. They hold that there are two stages&nbsp;in forming modern humans:</p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">Stage 1: Chimpanzees evolved into ancient humans known as Homo genus.</span></p></li><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">Stage 2: Homo erectus became extinct; it was replaced by modern humans also known as&nbsp;Homo sapiens.</span></p></li></ul>
<p class="font7">In the Book of Genesis, God created humans two times as well</p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">Humans were created by God in the sixth day (1:26-28)</span></p></li><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">Humans were created by God after the seventh day. These humans were Adam and Eve&nbsp;(2:7-25).</span></p></li></ul>
<p class="font7">Here we see similarities between findings in science and messages revealed in the Bible.</p>
<p class="font7">Humans that God created in the sixth day were Homo erectus. This species didn‘t yet have souls, thus they weren‘t the intelligent type. The ones that God created after the seventh day, Adam and&nbsp;Eve, are the intelligent human species Homo sapiens of today. This species is intelligent because&nbsp;God gave them souls.</p>
<p class="font7">Humans evolved from chimpanzees; God did this for two reasons:</p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">God did not create humans by multiplying his genes or the genes of the angels because&nbsp;their genes are perfect. This source of genes does not age nor get sick nor become infected by&nbsp;diseases, but is immortal. Therefore, if they were to use their genes to multiply humans, it&nbsp;would not work for underdeveloped souls of humans (soul will be explained in chapter 3).</span></p></li><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">The genes of chimpanzees, after God adjusted them to make humans, helps the body of&nbsp;humans adapt to the conditions of the environment, weather, and climate on Earth.</span></p></li></ul>
<p class="font7">Chimpanzee species, after God adjusted their gene structure, became Homo. This human species, although without souls, were spread to all continents except America via UFOs by the angels, so&nbsp;they could adapt to the local weathers and environments. After this species evolved up to a&nbsp;necessary physical readiness and, at the same time, the weather and environment conditions&nbsp;reach the required stability, God decided to release the intelligent human species. This time&nbsp;period is also known as the Last Ice Age, the same time as when humans first appeared in&nbsp;Americas over 10,000 years ago.</p>
<p class="font7">To release the intelligent human species, God and the angels needed to remove genetic codes related to intellectual and sentimental activities in the genes of the Homo erectus humans.&nbsp;Because of this, scientists find quite a number of genes in modern humans are useless. If this&nbsp;kind of information still stayed in human genes, it would affect the software programs in the&nbsp;soul. At the same time, God and the angels adjusted DNA to make different human races with&nbsp;various skin colors: Caucasians, Asians, Blacks, Indians, Native Indians, etc. The last and most&nbsp;important task was for God to install the soul to each human to become the intelligent human&nbsp;species, Homo sapiens.</p>
<p class="font7">After modern humans appeared, once again the angels used UFOs to spread them all over the world by groups of specific races. Then, the angels helped these groups settle their lives, taught&nbsp;each group a language to communicate, and taught them how to cultivate with basic techniques.&nbsp;Time went by, these groups self-reproduced and became crowded enough to form clans, tribes,&nbsp;races and eventually constituted nations. After God realized that the evolution of humans had&nbsp;reached a necessary stability level, he commanded the angels to leave the Earth and remove any&nbsp;traces of them being there. They continued guiding humans quietly from Heaven and from&nbsp;<a name="bookmark38"></a>outside of Earth. As God’s will, sometimes, biological robots and the angels arrive on Earth by&nbsp;UFOs to help humans.</p>

<h1><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>THE SOUL AND ITS OPERATION</span></h1>
<p class="font7">Humans are superior biological machines created by God and the angels. At a basic level, the way a human operates is similar to a computer. The brain of a human is a biological processor&nbsp;while the brain of a computer is a mechanical processor (CPU/hardware). The function of the&nbsp;soul to a person is analogous to the function of software programs to a computer. Data from an&nbsp;old computer can be copied to a new computer. In the same vein, God can take the soul of a dead&nbsp;person and install it to a new body.</p>
<h2><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>1. The Soul</span></h2>
<p class="font7">The soul of a person is a mass of information, including software programs with preeminent features programmed by God, and it contains all of the information that the person has&nbsp;experienced in all of their lives (this life and previous ones). Since the very first humans&nbsp;appeared on Earth, every time a person dies, God retrieves the soul and has it reincarnated into a&nbsp;new body. God uses a type of wave, called a super brainwave, to transmit souls. The speed of a&nbsp;super brainwave is infinite and no material can stop it from traveling. Super brainwaves are&nbsp;transmitted by superior technological equipment which resides with God. With our science and&nbsp;technology today, we are unable to read information from souls. Thus, we can only gain insights&nbsp;into how the soul works via the activities of our brains.</p>
<p class="font7">A soul is installed into the brain of a human fetus in the fourth month of maternity. According to medical studies, the brain of a human fetus grows quite complete during the fourth month. The&nbsp;Qur‘an of Islam also mentions that God gives souls to human fetuses in the fourth month of&nbsp;maternity (Hadith 3208 &amp; Hadith 1 &amp; 2643).</p>
<p class="font7">The human soul is comprised of three major components: the consciousness software program, the spirit software program, and the repository of past lives‘ information (RPLI).</p>
<h2><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>The Consciousness Software Program</span></h2><img src="The-Great-Truth_files/The-Great-Truth-16.jpg" style="width:428pt;height:239pt;"/>
<p class="font3">Results</p>
<p class="font4">Brain Operation Chart</p>
<h3><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>The Consciousness Software Program</span></h3>
<p class="font7">The consciousness software program‘s mission is to manage the operations of the brain. After being installed in the brain, this program helps the brain perceive and process information,&nbsp;introspect, think in the abstract, and use language. The consciousness software program&nbsp;distributes and forwards information received from five senses and extrasensory perception to&nbsp;the spirit software program or the subconscious. When it arrives in the subconscious, it then&nbsp;contacts the RPLI and pulls the related information into the central brain for the consciousness&nbsp;software program to process and yield results. The consciousness software program also saves&nbsp;the results it processed into subconscious memory. It can also read the information it previously&nbsp;saved in the subconscious memory for its use (via the function of recall). In summary, the&nbsp;operation of the consciousness software program is very complex; we simply cannot understand&nbsp;all of its functionality. At a lower level, we can understand the consciousness software program&nbsp;of humans similar to the system operating software of a computer such as Microsoft Windows&nbsp;OS or Apple Mac OS. Without this program, our brain cannot operate normally.</p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Spirit Software Program</span></p>
<p class="font7">The spirit software program‘s function is to create the various human emotions. The eight basic emotions that the spirit software program creates are pleasure, happiness, anger, love, hatred,&nbsp;sadness, desire, and fear. These emotions are grouped into three pairs of opposite qualities and&nbsp;one pair of neutral qualities.</p>
<p class="font7">Pleasure, happiness and non-couple love are three prime emotions inclined toward good. These can be individual emotions. When these emotions are activated and combined with one another,&nbsp;they create other good moods such as love between parents and children, siblings, friendship,&nbsp;kindness, altruism, mercy, and lots of other positive emotions.</p>
<p class="font7">On the other hand, anger, hatred, and sadness are three prime emotions inclined toward the bad. These can be individual emotions. When these emotions are activated and combined with one&nbsp;another, they create bad moods such as hostility, wickedness, selfishness, envy, pessimism,&nbsp;frustration, and lots of other negative emotions.</p>
<p class="font7">To better understand, we can visualize the way the spirit software program works as similar to a television screen which has only three primary colors (red, blue, green), but that, when playing,&nbsp;projects thousands or millions of colors onto the screen.</p>
<p class="font7">Desire is an emotion that has the ability to resonate with other emotions. It can help elevate good emotions, but it can also result in a magnification of negative emotions. A person‘s desires can&nbsp;be regulated by knowledge, will power, and especially morality. With good morals, excellent&nbsp;knowledge, and strong will one can regulate his desires in order to achieve the most appropriate&nbsp;and best possible outcome for his life.</p>
<p class="font7">Fear is a defensive emotion. Its function is to watch out for the needs of one‘s personal safety.</p>
<p class="font7">Fear can diminish good intentions as well as extinguish bad intentions. In other words, when our consciousness recognizes a danger, fear will appear automatically. However, fear can be&nbsp;controlled and regulated by people with a stable mind and strong will.</p>
<p class="font7">We know that human emotions are extremely complex, but ultimately it boils down to each emotion having its own characteristic properties. Rationality can control almost all human&nbsp;emotions, but rationality cannot conquer couple love. Couple love is a special emotion because it&nbsp;incorporates all eight emotions in the spirit software program. Among all types of relationships,&nbsp;couple love is the most intense. People are more willing to scarify for their lovers than for their&nbsp;parents, children, siblings, or friends.</p>
<p class="font7">We can recognize that most activities of the soul, especially the spirit software program, are based mainly on receptions from the five senses (sight, hearing, smell, touch, and taste) through&nbsp;daily interactions and activities. From this varied input, the consciousness software program&nbsp;processes and connects with the spirit software program, creating different moods. This process&nbsp;repeats many times and, as a result, establishes unique temperaments for each of us.</p>
<p class="font7">Because of this special spirit software program, humans have become the most advanced creatures on Earth.</p>
<h3><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Repository of Past Lives' Information (RPLI)</span></h3>
<p class="font7">The repository of past lives‘ information (RPLI) is an important component of the soul. The mission of the RPLI is to store information about a person‘s previous lives. To better understand&nbsp;the RPLI, we first need to differentiate the RPLI from the subconscious.</p>
<p class="font7">The subconscious stores all of the information that a person experiences from birth to death. An ordinary person can easily retrieve the information stored in his/her subconscious memory&nbsp;(through recall). There are two exceptions, however—remembering past lives and child&nbsp;prodigies, which will be explained later in this chapter.</p>
<p class="font7">The RPLI stores all of the information that a person experiences in all of his previous lives. This information includes knowledge, feelings, thoughts, and actions. In the first life of a soul, God&nbsp;equips the RPLI with only some basic information for instinctual operations. When a person&nbsp;dies, God collects all of the information recorded in the subconscious and puts it together in one&nbsp;package (like a computer folder). Each life of a soul is stored in a separate package, and all of the&nbsp;packages are installed into the brain of a fetus. This becomes the individual‘s RPLI for his&nbsp;current life. The central brain cannot retrieve information from the RPLI directly, however.&nbsp;Rather, in order for this information to feed into the consciousness software program, there must&nbsp;be leading information and it must go through the subconscious. Leading information is the&nbsp;information received either from the five senses, introspection, or extrasensory perception, and is&nbsp;related to the data stored in the RPLI. Because many humans have knowledge from previous&nbsp;lives available in the RPLI, there is a common phenomenon in which many people know more&nbsp;than they have actually learned in their current life.</p>
<p class="font7">In summary, God created the RPLI to give humans opportunities to re-use all of the knowledge and experiences gained in their previous lives for the purpose of assisting humankind in the&nbsp;evolutionary process.</p>
<h2><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>2. Phenomena Related to the RPLI</span></h2>
<p class="font7">In this section, we‘ll examine the following phenomena: inborn talents, child prodigies, geniuses, remembering past lives, homosexuality and bisexuality, inborn temperaments, holy maternal&nbsp;love, and feelings of familiarity (deja vu and love at first sight).</p>
<h3><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>Inborn Talents</span></h3>
<p class="font7">In the history of mankind, there have been many people who were born with exceptional talents in various subject areas, such as music, acting, literature, painting, etc.A talented person is&nbsp;someone with excellent ability in a certain area, particularly one he has not yet studied or&nbsp;practiced enough to have feasibly achieved said ability under normal conditions. This can be&nbsp;explained by the existence of the RLPI. People with inborn talents only need to have gained&nbsp;minimal knowledge related to their vocation in previous lives, and this knowledge then serves as&nbsp;leading information to activate the RLPI. This process allows the consciousness software&nbsp;program access to the related information in the RLPI.</p>
<p class="font7">In order to use the knowledge in the RPLI effectively, we need to, as early in life as possible, align our current vocation with vocations that we have pursued in our previous lives. We also&nbsp;need to update our knowledge in the visioning field and frequently contemplate the knowledge&nbsp;we have acquired.With practice, we will promote our talents to the fullest and realize success in&nbsp;life. Of course, new souls do not benefit from this practice since the repository of their past lives&nbsp;is virtually empty.</p>
<p class="font7">Oprah Winfrey (born 1954) is a talk show host and media producer. Winfrey is the first African-American billionaire and is considered the most influential woman in the world. When she was a little girl, she already possessed extraordinary talents in communication, and with this ability she&nbsp;become successful in her career.</p>
<p class="font7">Joanne Kathleen Rowling (born 1965), author of the famous Harry Potter fantasy book series, is another example. Before writing the series, she was a single mom living on government welfare.&nbsp;Today, her fantasy book series are liked by millions of readers, of all ages, all over the world.&nbsp;She has received many awards consecutively. As of 2012, her book series has sold 450 million&nbsp;copies.</p>
<h3><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>Child Prodigies</span></h3>
<p class="font7">A child prodigy is a purely scientific phenomenon that relates to the consciousness and the RPLI. This phenomenon is created by God to send humans a message to enable us to better understand&nbsp;Him and the soul.</p>
<p class="font7">For ordinary people and geniuses, all the data from their previous lives is stored in the RPLI. However, this is not the case for child prodigies. The way God makes child prodigies is as&nbsp;followed:</p>
<p class="font7">First of all, God selects some souls that, in their past lives, have had excellent knowledge in a certain field, such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, linguistics, biology, etc. He then filters&nbsp;only the knowledge related to their specialty and installs this information in the consciousness of&nbsp;a fetus. When an ordinary child is born, there is little information in the subconscious (apart from&nbsp;the information fetus receives while in the mother‘s stomach, such as when the mother talks to&nbsp;the fetus or plays music to it). However, in the case of a child prodigy, at the time of birth there&nbsp;has already been a huge mass of knowledge installed in his subconscious. Thus, when a prodigy&nbsp;is just a few years old, his knowledge is far greater than other children his age.</p>
<p class="font7">Wendy Vo (born 1999 in Charlotte, North Carolina) is a Vietnamese-American. At 2 years old, she could speak Vietnamese, English, Spanish, and Chinese. At 3, she could speak French,&nbsp;Japanese, Indian, Russian, and Cantonese. At 4, she learned Portuguese and musical theory, and&nbsp;began getting acquainted with musical instruments. At 6, she knew how to compose music, and&nbsp;at 10 she had composed more than 40 pieces of music. Forbes Magazine 2008 selected Wendy to&nbsp;be one of 10 representative teenagers of the world. Obviously, Wendy is considered to be a child&nbsp;prodigy.</p>
<p class="font7">Ainan Celeste Cawley from Singapore is also considered a child prodigy, in chemistry. When he was 6 months old he could walk, and at 1 year of age he could talk about complex matters with&nbsp;adults. At 3 years of age he could draw multi-dimensional objects, including objects with 100&nbsp;sides. At 7, he passed the O-level examination in chemistry. At 9, he obtained one more O-level&nbsp;certificate in physics. He could write and balance chemical equations, draw molecular structures,&nbsp;knew chemical properties, had knowledge of radiation, played music instruments, etc. He can&nbsp;learn very quickly, and is now studying lectures at the university level.</p>
<h3><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>Geniuses</span></h3>
<p class="font7">Geniuses are people who have transcendent intelligence, and whose works have a great influence on human civilization. To ensure the intellectual development and survival of humans in the age&nbsp;of the population boom, God specifically brings forth geniuses.</p>
<p class="font7">Similar to the phenomenon of child prodigies, before creating geniuses, God selects souls that have outstanding knowledge in certain fields, such as mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology,&nbsp;chemistry, etc. He then provides these souls with new important knowledge that is suitable for&nbsp;each developmental stage of humankind. God installs this knowledge, together with information&nbsp;from previous lives, and all of the information is kept in the RPLI of a genius. In the early years&nbsp;of a genius‘ life, the new knowledge in his RPLI would be quite vague if it showed up at all.&nbsp;When the brain structure is fully developed, the knowledge the genius has received through&nbsp;learning or experience becomes leading information which brings forth the related knowledge&nbsp;from the RPLI to the consciousness. Consequently, geniuses create transcendent works, and the&nbsp;knowledge revealed in these works is completely new to humans on Earth. There have been&nbsp;many prodigies in the past, but true geniuses are rare. God creates geniuses when appropriate,&nbsp;but he does not determine the time in advance.</p>
<p class="font7">Albert Einstein (1879-1955), a German-born theoretical physicist, is an example. People recognize him as the father of modern physics. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1921 for his&nbsp;contributions to physics, including the theory of relativity and his discovery of the law of&nbsp;photoelectric effect. He was voted by the NY Times to be —the man of the century.” He was the&nbsp;greatest scientist in the 20th century and the most prominent intellectual in history. Albert&nbsp;Einstein is considered a genius.</p>
<p class="font7">Another example is Pablo Picasso (1881-1973), a Spanish painter and sculptor. Picasso is considered one of the greatest and most influential artists of the 20th century. He is one of the&nbsp;top ten artists among of the 20th Century according to Times magazine. Picasso is considered a&nbsp;genius in the arts.</p>
<h3><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>Remembering Past Lives</span></h3>
<p class="font7">As mentioned above, the human soul is immortal, but the physical body at this time cannot be immortal like the soul. Therefore, to assist humankind in the evolutionary process, God&nbsp;continuously allows souls to be incarnated in new bodies. This process is called reincarnation.</p>
<p class="font7">Besides normal reincarnations described above, there are a few special cases of reincarnation that involve remembering one‘s past life. This phenomenon is somewhat similar to the child prodigy&nbsp;phenomenon. Reincarnation that involves remembering one‘s past life is also a message from&nbsp;God, helping humans to understand Him and how our souls work. Usually, people who can&nbsp;remember their past life did not have a long lifespan in their past life. The reincarnation process&nbsp;of these people is somewhat different. God installs information about the last life into the&nbsp;consciousness of this life—instead of the RPLI. Therefore, when one is born, his consciousness&nbsp;is already filled with information from his past life. His thinking and perceptions remain as if he&nbsp;had never died. We can think of these reincarnation cases as —dual lives” or “adjoining lives.” In&nbsp;these cases, the information package of the last life has been installed into the subconscious&nbsp;storage unit, into the same place where the information about the current life is stored, forming&nbsp;one information package for two lives.</p>
<p class="font7">Binh Lac Bui is an example. He was born 10/6/2002 at Coi Village, Yen Phu, Lac Son, Hoa. Binh, son of the Muong family. When he started to talk, he insisted that he was Tien Phu Quyet&nbsp;Nguyen, son of the Kinh family, born 2/28/1992 in Vu Ban town, who had died 10 years before&nbsp;Binh was born. Binh wanted to come back to live with the parents of the dead boy. After relating&nbsp;many pieces of evidence to prove that he was actually the dead boy, he was accepted by the&nbsp;parents of Tien as their dead son restored to life.</p>
<p class="font7">Similarly, Shanti Devi was born on 11/12/1926 in Delhi, India. When she was very young, Shanti Devi told her parents that her name was Lugdi Devi, that she lived in Mathura town, and&nbsp;was married to her husband Pandit Kedernath Chowbey, with whom she had a son named&nbsp;Nabanita Lall. People started to believe her after determining that what she said was correct. She&nbsp;even know the details about how Lugdi hid money under her bed before she died. Therefore,&nbsp;they accepted Shanti Devi as the soul of Lugdi Devi, who died 10/4/1925 and reincarnated into&nbsp;Shanti Devi.</p>
<h3><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark60"></a>Homosexuality and Bisexuality</span></h3>
<p class="font7">Homosexuality is a phenomenon that happens all over the world. Homosexual men are called gay, and homosexual women are called lesbian. Bisexuality refers to people who are sexually&nbsp;attracted to both men and women.</p>
<p class="font7">Homosexuality is not disease, as homosexual people cannot change who they are, nor can medicine or medical procedures. This is because homosexuality is rooted in the RPLI. When&nbsp;God created the spirit software program, he made one version for men and one version for&nbsp;women; they have different affection frequencies. Usually, a male soul is incarnated into a male&nbsp;fetus and a female soul is incarnated into a female fetus. However, there are many exceptions,&nbsp;which result in homosexuality and bisexuality.</p>
<p class="font7">The RPLI stores all the information of previous lives that a soul has experienced, including information about sexual activities, love activities, sexual habits, sexual feelings, etc. All of this&nbsp;information is stored in the RPLI, and it is revealed gradually as the child grows up.</p>
<p class="font7">A gayperson is born when a female soul is incarnated into a male physical body.Gay children show their feminine side as they grow up, and their sexual orientation will show more clearly&nbsp;when they reach puberty. Usually, this is the most difficult time for gays because their sexual&nbsp;desires and emotional needs start to surface in opposition with their physical body. When gays&nbsp;are in love and have sex with each other, in their mind, they think they are women.</p>
<p class="font7">A lesbian is born when a male soul is incarnated in a female physical body; lesbian children gradually show their masculinity. Like gay men, when lesbians are in love and have sex with&nbsp;each other, they always think they are men.</p>
<p class="font7">Bisexuals are similar to gays or lesbians: their souls and physical bodies are not in sync, meaning a male soul in a female physical body or a female soul in a male physical body. However,&nbsp;bisexuals are different from gays and lesbians in one aspect: they are new souls.</p>
<p class="font7">As pointed out above, the spirit software program of males and females are different in terms of affection frequencies. This difference gradually forms different love and sexual habits between&nbsp;men and women. All of the love feelings and sexual experiences from previous lives are stored&nbsp;in the RPLI; therefore, it would be very difficult for a person to adapt to their strange new&nbsp;feelings. For bisexual people, their souls have only lived a very few lives; thus, there are not too&nbsp;many of these experiences and feelings stored in the RPLI. For this reason, bisexuals can get&nbsp;married, have children, and have sex like ordinary people for a period of time; after a while,&nbsp;however, these sexual experiences will activate the RPLI. They then realize that their sexual&nbsp;orientation and desire are not really what they are experiencing. Finally, they decide to leave&nbsp;their husbands or wives to seek out their true feelings with homosexual partners. However, a few&nbsp;bisexuals decide to remain in asexual relationship with the same gender or opposite gender for&nbsp;all their life.</p>
<p class="font7">In the case of Ma Tin Aung Myo, a girl born on 26/12/1953 in the village of Nalthul in the north of Myanmar, she is a lesbian and can also remember her past life. Ma Tin Aung Myo identifies&nbsp;herself as a male Japanese soldier who died in the war, and has decided not to get married&nbsp;because she thinks she is a man.</p>
<h3><a name="bookmark61"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark62"></a>Inborn Temperament</span></h3>
<p class="font7">There is an old Vietnamese saying: “cha me sanh con trdi sanh tanh,” which means: —parents give birth to children but God gives them their temperaments.” This is in fact correct because&nbsp;parents can only give their children a physical body, while God is the one giving them a soul&nbsp;(temperament). It is often difficult to understand temperament formation in our children; children&nbsp;often show unique temperaments that are unlike anyone in the family, or even in their extended&nbsp;families. Even with lots of effort, parents can rarely change their children‘s temperaments.</p>
<p class="font7">People have realized this for a long time, but there has not been a satisfactory explanation of its causes. Why is it that some children show at an early age that they are dutiful to their parents,&nbsp;docile, studious, obedient, brave, courageous, lofty, and cannot stand wrongdoing, while other&nbsp;children are shy, fearful, pessimistic, sad, and lonely, or even stubborn, hot-tempered,&nbsp;aggressive, lazy, and feisty?</p>
<p class="font7">We recognize that children reveal their unique temperaments earlier than what they obtain from their parent‘s instruction. Temperament can be explained clearly when we consider the concept&nbsp;of the RPLI. In order for humans to evolve, God has every soul live many lives via reincarnation;&nbsp;thus, the temperament is already well established in previous lives and is stored in the RPLI.&nbsp;Therefore, the formation of temperament in children or adults largely results from the RPLI.</p>
<p class="font7">Emotional perception is among the first things a child perceives in his life when interacting with parents, grandparents, siblings, neighbors, and schoolmates. This emotional perception serves as&nbsp;leading information to activate the RPLI. The related information in the RPLI is revealed to the&nbsp;consciousness software program, this process, in addition to parents‘ teaching, gradually forms&nbsp;the temperament of a child.</p>
<p class="font7">There is also another old saying: —Non song de doi, ban tmh kho doi,” which means: —It is easier to move mountains and rivers than to change one‘s temperament.”We see many changes in the&nbsp;world, but we hardly ever see a person changing their temperament. Some people are kind and&nbsp;generous, while others are brutal and hot tempered; some are shy and fearful, while others are&nbsp;wicked and dishonest. Their temperaments rarely change throughout their entire lives.</p>
<p class="font7">As a parent, if we realize our children have poor temperaments and try our best to teach them but they still do not change, we should not blame ourselves, because their nature has been&nbsp;established previously.</p>
<h3><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark64"></a>Holy Maternal Love</span></h3>
<p class="font7">Throughout their lives, good mothers love, sacrifice, and care for their children. These mothers consider motherhood a holy duty, and the ultimate happiness of their life. In past societies, most&nbsp;women took very little interest in public duties; they mainly did housework and take care of their&nbsp;children and their homes. In feudal times and before, if one‘s husband died young, the wife&nbsp;rarely remarried. Instead, she devoted her time to raising her children and living with them and&nbsp;her grandchildren until the end of her life. The emotional experiences associated with maternal&nbsp;love are repeated life after life; thus, we often see that mothers love more and are more willing to&nbsp;sacrifice for their children than fathers. And in return, most children love their mothers more&nbsp;than their fathers.</p>
<p class="font7">When mothers—especially mothers with old souls—look at their children‘s faces after delivery, no matter how good-looking/bad-looking and healthy/disabled the child is, their love manifests&nbsp;strongly.</p>
<p class="font7">This special emotion does not just arise from nowhere; it is accumulated in the RPLI through many lives as a mother. However, not every mother has such great love for her children. There&nbsp;are cases wherein mothers, after delivery, throw their babies in trash cans, public toilets, on&nbsp;streets, etc. What causes those mothers to be so heartless? The reason is that these mothers have&nbsp;new souls, and they were not taught properly while growing up when their personality was&nbsp;forming. These souls are first-time mothers. Therefore, there is no information related to&nbsp;maternal love in their RPLI. As a result, they throw their children away easily.</p>
<h3><a name="bookmark65"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark66"></a>Feeling of Familiarity—Deja Vu</span></h3>
<p class="font7">There are times in our life when we travel to a place we have never visited before—a house, a street, a village, or even a strange country. These places are not necessarily beautiful landscapes&nbsp;or luxurious houses, or even magnificent streets or a modern developed country. These places&nbsp;could be ordinary places, but upon arriving we have an intense feeling of familiarity and&nbsp;closeness in our heart. Many people say that they have experienced this feeling many times in&nbsp;their life, but they cannot explain it. These is called —deja vu,” it comes from the RPLI.</p>
<p class="font7">Most of us are not aware of who we were in our previous lives, or where we lived and what we did. Although our consciousness does not know this (except in cases of reincarnation where&nbsp;previous lives are remembered), all the images, memories, emotions, etc. of one‘s previous lives&nbsp;are stored in our RPLI. Therefore, the places that we visit today may be where we used to work&nbsp;or live in our previous lives, or places that impressed us with wonderful memories. Many people,&nbsp;when visiting a foreign country for the first time, have a strong sense of familiarity and closeness&nbsp;with that country. They eventually decide to live there for the rest of their lives. This could be&nbsp;because they used to be a citizen of that country in their previous lives.</p>
<h3><a name="bookmark67"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark68"></a>Love at First Sight</span></h3>
<p class="font7">In order to find the cause of love at first sight, we first need to know the difference of the two concepts: —an ideal lover” and —a lover in dreams.”</p>
<p class="font7">An ideal lover is a product of our imagination. For example, when a girl thinks of her ideal lover or husband, she thinks of a handsome, rich, intelligent man or a nice, gentle, faithful guy.&nbsp;Similarly, when a young man thinks of his ideal girlfriend or wife, he envisions a beautiful,&nbsp;gentle, sweet, well-mannered woman. These are examples of ideal lovers which are drawn from&nbsp;personal preferences.</p>
<p class="font7">On the other hand, a person who has a dream lover cannot clearly identify the figure, face, or personality of their lover or spouse-to-be. This is because the information about the dream lover&nbsp;is stored in their RPLI and their consciousness cannot reach this section without leading&nbsp;information.</p>
<p class="font7">For example, in his previous life, a man had a very beautiful wife and the love they had for each other was very passionate and deep. They were living happily together when the husband died&nbsp;young, causing such a great shock to the wife. She became mentally ill for the rest of her life.</p>
<p class="font7">As another example, in their previous life, a man and a woman were deeply in love with each other, but for some reason they were not allowed to be together. Later, the woman killed herself&nbsp;and the man was very regretful and missed the woman until the end of his life.</p>
<p class="font7">Finally, as another example, in their previous life, a man and a woman were deeply in love with each other, and they swore they would marry and love each other forever. Unfortunately, both of&nbsp;them were killed in an accident.</p>
<p class="font7">There is similarity between all three examples above: these people were deeply in love with their partners in their previous lives. And of course, when they reincarnated into this life, the emotion&nbsp;and images of their lovers were still deeply engraved in their RPLI. Despite lots of opportunities&nbsp;for them to have love relationships with different people, they usually do not have feelings for&nbsp;them. This is not because the people they meet do not meet their standards, but because the&nbsp;people they meet do not have personalities, gestures, or appearance similar to their lovers in their&nbsp;previous lives. Then, one day, they meet their previous-life lover, and both immediately&nbsp;recognize each other by the other‘s familiar personality, gestures and/or appearance, as this is&nbsp;leading information which activates their RPLI. From then on, the love they previously had for&nbsp;each other surfaces to form an intense love, and even they themselves do not realize how deeply&nbsp;in love with each other they were in a past life. Love stories of similar scenarios are often called&nbsp;love at first sight.</p>
<p class="font7">In addition, there are other cases related to loving emotions kept in the RPLI, but these are onesided love. For example, a man adores and loves a woman, but the infatuation remains one-sided (unrequited love). Although his love is not returned, his feelings for this woman are still very&nbsp;intense and enduring. He would provide anything she needs and is always ready to sacrifice for&nbsp;her without asking for anything in return.</p>
<p><a name="bookmark69"></a><span class="font7">We know that love at first sight is a case where two people fall passionately in love with each other from their previous life experiences when they luckily meet again in their present lives.&nbsp;However, with one-sided love, only one side has passionate love from the previous life, while the&nbsp;other person has nothing to do with this love. In the present life, the appearance, gestures, and&nbsp;personality of the other person is similar to that of the previous lover; thus, the RPLI is falsely&nbsp;activated and leads to one-sided love.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark70"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Chapter 4</span></h1>
<h1><a name="bookmark71"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark72"></a>FATE &amp; KARMA</span></h1>
<p class="font7">The fate of a person is generally thought to be the arrangement made for one before one is born, and it is unchangeable. But where does fate come from? Who arranges and manages it and for&nbsp;what purpose? Up until this point, no one has had clear answers to these questions. Nevertheless,&nbsp;many people believe in fate. Others do not believe in or accept the idea of fate. Is fate real, or is&nbsp;it a concept imagined by humans? Is fate a superstition, or can it be explained scientifically?</p>
<p class="font7">As discussed in chapter 2, to search for answers, we first need to gather related information from many sources. Then we can look for hidden clues which will help us see through the nature of&nbsp;the subject. We‘ll use the same method here to understand fate.</p>
<p class="font7">Fate, according to the teachings of Buddhism, as well as some Eastern religions, exists because of karma (the natural law that deals with cause and effect in a person‘s life). All of our deeds,&nbsp;whether good or bad, moral or wicked, kindhearted or cold hearted, that we carried out in our&nbsp;previous lives shall be naturally reflected in and influence our current life. This Buddhist&nbsp;teaching sounds reasonable, but there are still two weak points about this view:</p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">First, if there was no supreme power to manage reincarnation, the souls would freely&nbsp;choose the family in which to be born. This would lead to situations where evil souls would&nbsp;oppress good souls and incarnate into the fetuses of rich, luxurious, and powerful families.&nbsp;And the good souls, as a result of being less competitive, would end up in poor and less&nbsp;fortunate families. Incidentally, bad souls would be blessed and the good souls would suffer.&nbsp;Therefore, the concept of karma in Buddhism turns out to be ineffective and not promoting&nbsp;fairness.</span></p></li><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">Second, in Buddhist teachings, the concept of God does not exist. Humans are not guided&nbsp;by any deity. If this is the case, there‘s no one to create souls. Instead, souls are available&nbsp;naturally when people are born. This can be understood to mean that the soul is merely an&nbsp;abstraction of human rationality and emotion and is a product of nature; after a human dies,&nbsp;everything ends. What we have in this life is the result of the choices and decisions we made&nbsp;in this life, without any intervention from any supernatural being. Thus, if there is no soul,&nbsp;there will be no reincarnation or karma. Evil deeds people did in their previous lives will not&nbsp;be reflected in their current life.</span></p></li></ul>
<p class="font7">Muslims consider fate to be a very important factor in one‘s life. According to Islam, human fate is part of God‘s will. It is said that God sets the fate of each person before birth, and that fate will&nbsp;follow him for all his life unchangeable. The concept of fate in Islam is unreasonable and unfair&nbsp;in these two respects:</p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">First, if God is a supreme power who is benevolent and wise, why would He treat the&nbsp;souls He has created unfairly? Some people live lives full of happiness, wealth, and success,&nbsp;while others are poor, miserable, and unhappy for all of their lives. If there‘s nothing else to&nbsp;add this discussion, God is indeed unfair in His treatment of different people.</span></p></li><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">Second, why does God creates fate for humans but not allow humans to have free will? If&nbsp;fate is unchangeable, do we need to try hard to succeed in life? If we do good deeds for&nbsp;others, how does God reward us if He has already predetermined all aspects of our life? If&nbsp;fate is unchangeable, is His revelation for commandments—supposedly for the purpose of&nbsp;teaching humans—necessary?</span></p></li></ul>
<p class="font7">Meanwhile, the concept of fate is rather vaguely described in the Christian Bible. Most of Christianity followers say that God punishes all of mankind because Adam and Eve ate the&nbsp;forbidden fruit (fruits that came from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil). This concept is&nbsp;called the original sin. This concept also has two shortcomings:</p>
<p class="font7">First, Christianity views original sin as being the cause of all punishment—God punishes all mankind entirely because Adam and Eve committed a sin, and it has nothing to do with the&nbsp;sins of their descendants (i.e., later humans). If we said that God is all about punishments, to&nbsp;whom would we give credit for the greatness of life? Thus, the concept of original sin in&nbsp;Christianity only sees the negative side, but does not see the positive side that God provides&nbsp;for mankind.</p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">Second, it is unreasonable for God to continue punishing all mankind just because of our&nbsp;ancestors‘ sins. We know that equality is a very significant principle for God, so why would&nbsp;He behave in such a ridiculous manner? Where is His righteousness? Does He really care&nbsp;about the equality of human souls? Is this the God that we come to expect?</span></p></li></ul>
<p class="font7">Before you continue to talk about fate, let us look into the concepts of God's punishment from religion‘s perspectives. We know that the cause of punishment is from fear and therefore we take&nbsp;revenge, to protect our interest or because someone did not do what we want someone else to do.&nbsp;But let us think for a second, does our God really fear of anyone or anything? Does God need to&nbsp;protect his fame, as no one can offend God or defame of him. As for benefits, we must know that&nbsp;God is the great creator, should He need protection that much. Particularly with our idea that&nbsp;because people do not follow or disobey God's commands thet should be punished by God is&nbsp;indeed wrong. Because once we believe that God created us and everything He has created those&nbsp;for us. Above all He gives us free will. If that is so, then for what reason he also forces us to&nbsp;follow Him, choose according to His will, obey Him or otherwise we‘ll be punished. What kind&nbsp;of free will is that? It‘s not acceptable. Given free will, humans should be able to choose&nbsp;according to our will. Humans should be able to choose either good or bad, virtue or mischief,&nbsp;left or right because we would like to, why we should be punished. In case God does not want&nbsp;humans to have free will to choose, God have a chose not to make them but in reality it is the&nbsp;opposite. Surely, God does not interfere or prevent human choices, we have complete free will to&nbsp;decide for our desires to deeds. God does not punish anyone of us even though one is extremely&nbsp;cruel, God does either reward or punish anyone, everything we have today reflect the results of&nbsp;our own choosing in our past live. Today we choose to mischief, we will be living in evil in the&nbsp;next life. Today we choose to do good deeds; we will be repaid with happiness. God's job is to&nbsp;ensure that our choices can be carried out, everyone have opportunity to perform. Finally we&nbsp;understand that everything happens to us is due to the law of causality, not the punishment from&nbsp;God. He never had punished anyone and that will never happen neither.</p>
<p class="font7">After analyzing the viewpoints of these three major religions concerning the topic of fate, we find that they all have major shortcomings from a logical standpoint. But when we weave these&nbsp;viewpoints together and then eliminate invalid points while holding on to the good aspects, we&nbsp;can see clear, logical, and reasonable viewpoints about fate. They are as follows:</p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font7">1. &nbsp;The reason God created fate for each person is the sin of the very first humans on Earth.&nbsp;This view draws on the concept of original sin in Christianity.</p></li><li>
<p class="font7">2. &nbsp;The criteria for God to determine fate for humans is based on the deeds we carried out in&nbsp;our previous life. All of our deeds, good for bad, in our previous life will be reflected in this&nbsp;life, either as a blessing or a punishment. God makes this happens according to the law of&nbsp;cause and effect. But in order to fulfill fate in a fair and natural way, our souls must&nbsp;reincarnate to receive reflections about our previous life. This view draws on the concepts of&nbsp;karma and reincarnation in Buddhism.</p></li><li>
<p class="font7">3. &nbsp;God sets a fate for each human, and then manages and fulfills it. This view of fate draws&nbsp;on Islam. Fate is pre-determined and unchangeable because its foundation is based on our&nbsp;deeds from our last life. Our deeds in this life will be reflected on the next life.</p></li></ul>
<p class="font7">In addition, to have a better understanding of fate, we will analyze a line in the Qur‘an of Islam: —And you do not will except that Allah wills. Indeed, Allah is ever Knowing and Wise.”&nbsp;(SURAH AL - INSAN 30). We’ll break this line into three verses:</p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“And you do not will”</span></p>
<p class="font7">In this verse, God says that, whether we like it or not, our life will be affected by the fate. In other words, we are being governed by karma.</p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Except that Allah wills.”</span></p>
<p class="font7">In this verse, God explicitly says that it’s His will, and He says so without explanation. We know that when God creates a new soul, it initially includes only the consciousness software program&nbsp;and the spirit software program; the subconscious storage and the RPLI storage are empty. That&nbsp;is what we all have in the beginning. God lets us have total free will in our first life. But in&nbsp;humans arose desires, ambition, selfishness, and cruelty, which caused damage and suffering to&nbsp;other humans. Thus, God has employed the law of cause and effect in order to arrange fate for&nbsp;everyone after the first life. We cannot say that God wants to arrange fate for the purpose of&nbsp;expressing power or his own interests, but all the benefits are for humans (all the practical&nbsp;benefits of fate will be analyzed further in the following section)</p>
<p class="font7">Thus, God designed fate to punish sin and reward good deeds so we can grow; and of course this must be done according to His principles of righteousness. At the core of fate, we should see that&nbsp;when God sets fate for each human it is because of the sins each person committed.</p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Indeed, Allah is ever Knowing and Wise.”</span></p>
<p class="font7">Humans, because of our general misunderstanding the meaning of fate, often think God created fate for His own amusement. But with our new understanding of fate, we should realize that God&nbsp;is extremely knowledgeable and ultimately wise.</p>
<p class="font7">The origin and cause of karma shall be understood as follows: God puts forth the human fate mainly to maintain the supreme law of the universe and above all help humans evolve. God does&nbsp;not equip fate for those who currently have new soul. Fate is only possible after people actually&nbsp;go through life first. God arranges fate before birth of a person and performs course of events for&nbsp;humans on the basis of the law of karma. All the activities of our life in this life serves as criteria&nbsp;for the fate of next life. So, reincarnation and fate are necessary for the evolution of man.</p>
<p class="font7">To better understand how God is ever knowing and wise in His imposing of fate on humans, we will study some examples:</p>
<h3><a name="bookmark73"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark74"></a>Example 1:</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini (1883 -1945), the leader of the National Fascist Party</span></p></li><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">Adolf Hitler (1889 -1945), the dictator of Nazi Germany</span></p></li></ul>
<p class="font7">These two people represent the world‘s top criminals. If these two people were allowed to reincarnate freely, this world would be an extremely unsafe place because their knowledge of&nbsp;leadership, their cruelty, and their dictatorial characteristics still remain in their RPLI. They&nbsp;would once again be successful in spreading wars and death. The fate God sets for them will&nbsp;reflect all their deeds in the previous life; therefore, they will be punished with poverty, sickness,&nbsp;and failure. Even if their cruelty and ambition to rule the world arises, they cannot do what they&nbsp;want. Continuously living in poverty and misfortune for several lives shall make them change&nbsp;their personality and ultimately become good.</p>
<h3><a name="bookmark75"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark76"></a>Example 2:</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">Columbian serial killer Pedro Alonso Lopez was accused of raping and killing more than&nbsp;300 girls and women in Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador.</span></p></li><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">Russian serial killer Andiu Chikatilo committed the murder of 53 women and children.</span></p></li><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">Ukrainian serial killer Anatoly Onoprienko confessed to killing 52 people.</span></p></li></ul>
<p class="font7">As cruel and savage as these people are, if God did not impose fate on them, what would happen to our communities once these individuals are reincarnated and came back to life? Their fate&nbsp;determines that they will be born with disability, immobility, poverty, and misery; even if cruelty&nbsp;arises in their mind, they would not be able act it out. The fairness of karma law will help change&nbsp;their wicked characteristics and ultimately make them inclined to be good.</p>

<p class="font7">These two people work in different fields, but they both strive to contribute significantly to our society. They worked hard to make money and create wealth, but once they succeeded, they did&nbsp;not keep it all for themselves, but gave most of their wealth to charity. Their charity work has&nbsp;supported many families in hardship around the world, and they do it with a compassionate&nbsp;heart—not out of self-interest.</p>
<p class="font7">In fact, there are so many great people in the world that we could never list them all in this book. However, in the case of the two people mentioned above, in their next life, God will certainly set&nbsp;a wonderful fate for them because they deserve a life full of fortune, happiness, wealth, and&nbsp;success. Wouldn‘t that be fair and reasonable? The fact that God continues to bless them with&nbsp;success and wealth is because it‘s likely that these people will continue to show compassion as&nbsp;they are doing in their present life; this is an indirect way God helps other humans.</p>
<p class="font7">Usually, rich people try to become richer for their own enjoyment, or to save for their children. They seldom share their wealth with others. As a result, they use up their blessing account and&nbsp;forget to do good deeds for the next life. Very few of them have a compassionate heart like Bill&nbsp;Gates and Jackie Chan. Therefore, we can consider Bill Gates and Jackie Chan to be among the&nbsp;highly evolved souls.</p>
<h3><a name="bookmark79"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark80"></a>Example 4:</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">Mahatma Gandhi (1869-1948) was the preeminent leader of Indian nationalism. Gandhi&nbsp;led India to independence (1947) and inspired movements for non-violence, civil rights, and&nbsp;freedom across the world.</span></p></li><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">Ho Chi Minh (1890-1969) was a revolutionary activist and the leader of the national&nbsp;liberation movements. He was the president of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (19451969).</span></p></li></ul>
<p class="font7">These two people were exceptional figures whose talents and virtue are well respected. In the context of this book, we don‘t discuss the political viewpoints of Ho Chi Minh and Mahatma&nbsp;Gandhi. What we will discuss, however, is their lifestyles, morality, and dignity. Ho Chi Minh&nbsp;and Mahatma Gandhi both worked hard and devoted their lives to the independence, happiness,&nbsp;and development of their countries. Once they gained success and respect, they continued to live&nbsp;a simple, economical, and whole-hearted lifestyle. To them, self-pleasure was not necessary;&nbsp;their most significant desire was to see their country and their people living in peace, prosperity,&nbsp;happiness, and freedom.</p>
<p class="font7">With such outstanding achievements and excellent virtues, God will certainly give these two fates with great advantages in their next life. God will let them reincarnate to live in a more&nbsp;developed country, and to become leaders that are loved and well respected by many people.&nbsp;Continuing to support these people to become successful and to become great leaders of other&nbsp;countries is an indirect way God helps the people in those countries</p>
<p class="font7">The morality and dignity of Mahatma Gandhi and Ho Chi Minh cause us to be deeply impressed. Often, power and wealth can change people‘s behaviors. Typically, the initial viewpoints of&nbsp;political activists are to serve the people, and are therefore highly respected. But when they gain&nbsp;enough power and wealth, they may change their lifestyles. If a soul has not been strengthened&nbsp;through many incarnations, it won‘t have the great characteristics of Mahatma Gandhi and Ho&nbsp;Chi Minh. Thus, we can say that people like Mahatma Gandhi and Ho Chi Minh are the most&nbsp;highly evolved souls.</p>
<p class="font7">Not all of us want to be bound by fate, but it is ultimately good for us, as our evolution has not yet progressed to a high level. We need fate because all of our wicked thoughts and cruel actions&nbsp;from our previous lives are still stored in our RLPI. Once we are reincarnated into a new body&nbsp;we are likely to follow our old path. Fate helps us suppress negative tendencies and push us in a&nbsp;positive direction. God sets fate for good people to have better opportunities to further develop&nbsp;their positive morality and dignity. For wicked people, God uses fate to inhibit negative nature&nbsp;that remained in their souls.</p>
<p class="font7">We should not mistakenly believe that God sets fate for humans for the purpose of controlling and restraining our mentality, like a machine. The fact that fate is predetermined and&nbsp;unchangeable does not mean that we do not have free will. If we did not have free will, our lives&nbsp;would be meaningless, so is God‘s divine plan. However, our free will to do good or bad deeds&nbsp;in this life will be reflected in the fate of the next life. God and the angels do not always have to&nbsp;intervene our thoughts and deeds. There are many ways that God executes fate to carry out the&nbsp;predetermined course of events accordingly.</p>
<p class="font7">The first is through heredity. In our daily life, we see many families and clans who are excellent at certain professions, such as politics, music, business, traditional crafts, etc. It is often said that&nbsp;they are good at these particular fields because they inherit good genes from their families. In&nbsp;reality, human heredity only contributes to physical traits and the brain‘s processing speed. All&nbsp;other characteristics are from the soul that God selected for reincarnation. The virtues and skills&nbsp;of the selected souls need be suitable for the parents. God often does this so children have talents&nbsp;that are aligned with their parents‘ professions. This enables them to develop their skills more&nbsp;effectively. And vice versa—parents also have advantages in helping their children to pursue&nbsp;family careers. Apparently, in these cases God has a dual purpose: He sets fate for these people&nbsp;in addition to helping the people with the best conditions evolve.</p>
<p class="font7">Nevertheless, there are cases whereby children totally hate to work in their parents‘ professions, and are more interested in pursuing other professions that are not at all related to their traditional&nbsp;family careers. The reason for this is that during pregnancy God cannot find any soul that has&nbsp;both virtues and skills suitable to the parents. Therefore, he gives priority to the virtue aspect and&nbsp;drops the other. For instance, we have cases of “pha gia chi tu” (children that bring misfortune to&nbsp;the family) or cases whereby rich parents bear abnormal children. It initially appears that in these&nbsp;cases the virtues of parents and children do not match. However, these cases are accurate&nbsp;arrangements of karma‘s law. If parents have children that bring misfortune to the family, it‘s&nbsp;because their fate says they must face the problem carried on from the past life. If parents have&nbsp;children with abnormality, it‘s because their fate does not have blessing in that aspect and all are&nbsp;reflection of their deeds from the past life.</p>
<p class="font7">Besides heredity, God also has His angels carry out events in fate by using super brainwaves. We usually think that our thoughts and actions are ours alone. In reality, angels can use super&nbsp;brainwaves to send messages directly to our brains or maneuver information in the RPLI to&nbsp;manipulate our decisions and actions. The angels do this quietly so that we think all of our&nbsp;decisions and actions are really ours. Angel‘s interventions leading our thoughts and actions to&nbsp;success or failure must be in accordance with the predetermined course of events written in our&nbsp;fate. When this happens, people often say that they were induced by God or by some other deity.</p>
<p class="font7">In fact the effect of the law of karma is so magnificent and transformative, we only see a small upper part of the iceberg. Currently we cannot know all of the magnificence of the law of karma.&nbsp;Therefore, when referring to human fate we often assume that God has employed his supreme&nbsp;power to impose human fate. Using his supreme power to punish those who do not follow His&nbsp;teachings, bring misery and hell for those who do not believe in God. In fact God is the Creator,&nbsp;who always loves and helps us, as observer. He does not punish or favor anyone. All His work&nbsp;and that of the Angels are based on the law of karma. Actually fate is an essential part of the&nbsp;supreme cause and effect law of the universe. The karma law influence on the entire universe&nbsp;and it always respond to everything perfectly natural and accurate.</p>
<p class="font7">Below are the responses of the natural law of cause and effect without the intervention of any one force. For example, when human pursue deforestation, air pollution, the law of cause and&nbsp;effect will reflect naturally with negative feedback on the ozone layer, global warming, snow&nbsp;melting, sea level rise, drought, hurricanes. When humans over-employed of natural resources&nbsp;affecting tectonic structure, earthquake and tsunami happen and cause negative impact on our&nbsp;lives. Or to put it another way, these phenomenon are created by humans, not by happenstance&nbsp;and that is the law of cause and effect. A more straightforward example, the brutal murder of&nbsp;robbery, drug trafficking or do something illegal and the judge treated these people in prison or&nbsp;the death penalty. So we have to acknowledge the fact that the judge has the duty of law&nbsp;enforcement, rather than use their power to punish offenders. In contrast, there were many&nbsp;scientists, politicians, writers, social activists dedicated to social work and many other useful&nbsp;jobs for people. Because of their work honor society and among them may have received the&nbsp;Nobel Prize, but we cannot assume that the council approved the award has rewarded the award&nbsp;recipients, they specific work to honor. From this example we can see the presence of the law of&nbsp;cause and effect and we can give God innocuous, that all happened because human‘s causes.</p>
<p class="font7">Human fate is also a result of the law of cause and effect. However, in order to make it absolutely fair, God and the Angels must control and arrange in accordance with the course of&nbsp;events in the fate. We will learn more in a few cases:</p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font7">1) For example: Today, for any reason, that we intentionally cause someone blind, then in&nbsp;the next life we will be blind. God operate the law of karma so as to let us experience&nbsp;ourselves the suffering of the blind, which we had given to others.</p></li><li>
<p class="font7">2) Example: A manufacturer of a product knows that the product may cause health or&nbsp;carcinogenic to consumers but for profits he move forward regardless. So according to&nbsp;the law of karma, in the next life he has cancer and experiences the pain of people with&nbsp;cancer.</p></li><li>
<p class="font7">3) A leader overuse power and oppress the people in corruption and harassment causing&nbsp;much suffering to the people, according to the law of karma in the next life he will&nbsp;experience all of what he had brought to others.</p></li><li>
<p class="font7">4) A person with a family living in peace and happiness, but his extramarital affair brings&nbsp;suffering to his spouse. According to the law of karma, then in the next life, this person&nbsp;will be betrayed by his lover or spouse for no obvious reason and painfully, let them&nbsp;experience the pain of people being betrayed.</p></li><li>
<p class="font7">5) For example: A child disrespects his parents, of course in the next life this child will&nbsp;experience the pain of parents with children treating him with disrespect and irreverent.</p></li><li>
<p class="font7">6) For example: Today we are white, so we always have an attitude of discrimination&nbsp;against black people. According to the law of karma, someday we will be a black person&nbsp;to experience that feeling stigmatized by others. Today I was rich, but I always despise&nbsp;the poor, someday I will be the poor to experience the feeling of contempt from others.&nbsp;Today we claim to be the smart and always look down on people poorer than us and call&nbsp;them stupid, someday I will be as stupid to experience the feeling of others.</p></li><li>
<p class="font7">7) In contrast, for example: In life there are people who always devote themselves to&nbsp;society, always share the love, money and help others unconditionally and from the&nbsp;actions of this person, some people have overcome difficulties, and bring joy and&nbsp;happiness. So according to the law of karma, the next life who will be destined with&nbsp;conditions for them to experience the joy and happiness they have brought to others.</p></li><li>
<p class="font7">8) For example; a teacher gives his students a lot of useful knowledge, and only base on&nbsp;love and dedication to the students. According to the law of karma, in the next life, he&nbsp;will not only get abundant knowledge, but also get what the students have achieved&nbsp;(which could be money, fame, happiness, etc.) by source of knowledge that teachers&nbsp;bring them in the past.</p></li></ul>
<p class="font7">In general, the law of karma is very magnificent, it is not simply as today we help other people money, someday we receive the money or today we help others to get fame, someday we have&nbsp;fame or today we help others to become leaders someday we become leaders. Therefore, we only&nbsp;need to live in morality, we get benefits and let others gain benefit. We make ourselves happy&nbsp;and bring happiness and success to others as well. We shall try to love more with dedication and&nbsp;sharing. We shall work hard, anything even smallest tasks as long as it brings joy and happiness&nbsp;to others, those are true virtue.</p>
<p class="font7">But in reality humans do not know what we did in the past lives, so most of us do not accept or reject fate. And although there are many who do not believe in fate but when facing adversity,&nbsp;people often blame God for being unjust, unfair to them. And then they see others‘ happiness and&nbsp;success with envious eyes, and they said that the success is due to God‘s bias. In other words,&nbsp;they think that these people are lucky, fortunate, or blessing and not from talents. Indeed, it‘s not&nbsp;easy to be God at all, He had to listen to all of the prayers for things that people did not want to&nbsp;create (and, in fact, people always want to ask what they do not have, but they do not want to&nbsp;create for themselves). He always have to listen to the complaints and blames from humans.</p>
<p class="font7">When analyzing fate, we realize that when people do not accept the reality of the situation as it is when they suffer most. Who do not accept the situation, in himself has produced boredom, envy,&nbsp;jealousy, desire, and many other bad potential in his thoughts. Since that would make them&nbsp;desire to be in any cost and do anything to change the current situation quickly or end it. We&nbsp;know that when someone is in a bad situation, which they do not accept it, usually they will&nbsp;switch to search for success. But in fact, if they do so, most of their actions will lead them to fail&nbsp;and their lives will most likely get worse. For example: A person born in a poor family, but they&nbsp;do not accept themselves as the poor, they want lots of money quickly to meet the demand and&nbsp;spend it wastefully. This, the majority will go into the wrong path and son, probably become&nbsp;thieves, daughter, to become prostitutes. For example: As a kind of education, knowledge is very&nbsp;limited, communication is very poor, but they do not accept it and do not see your weakness.&nbsp;They always want to do more work to work, of course it will go to failure. For example: a man&nbsp;carrying a disease but they do not have all the treatment options and when the pain occurs, they&nbsp;take or injected with painkillers, in order to end immediately the pain. Their course work will&nbsp;cause consequences. There are also situations where people are required to go through old age&nbsp;and death the things that we can not avoid. But if we accept that and treat it as a natural&nbsp;consecutive to the life of every human being, it is likely we will no longer feel the fear and see it&nbsp;as a pain anymore.</p>
<p class="font7">Not accepting the reality of the situation is completely different from accepting the actual situation itself. Acceptance does not mean accepting surrender, but get to know yourself in a&nbsp;situation, your current position in life, his position in the family and in society and to appreciate&nbsp;the power of the self. So, when a person accept the reality of the situation itself, also means to&nbsp;accept fate, so they know what to do to fit the actual circumstances, since they will strive to find&nbsp;opportunities, as well as joy and happiness in life, then over time the feeling of anguish will not&nbsp;be too heavy for them.</p>
<p class="font7">In fact we will not be able to eliminate desire, envy, passion, anger, hate, bored out to make the hearts of all suffering. For in the soul of each of us exists emotional nature both good and bad.&nbsp;Our things to do right now is not a waiver of that or set aside what we think is not good for&nbsp;yourself on the path to reach perfection. We already know from the past until now, not at the&nbsp;level respect willingness to earth and bring the body of the earth to guide us. But we also know&nbsp;that to get the holiness and perfection so, they themselves have been through a process of rebirth&nbsp;and new long-term evolution achieve perfect holiness, but they are not who God created to&nbsp;become Divine instantly. Because of the fact that Buddha said that &quot;today's I am Buddhist&nbsp;tomorrow you will be Buddhist&quot; and the Buddha that he often mentioned is the high life evolved&nbsp;in the universe.</p>
<p class="font7">We should understand that everything that today we believe is suffering, unhappiness or happiness, wealth, fame is what God wants us everyone has to walk through this life. He knows&nbsp;that our souls really need to experience the reality of our souls have a chance to mature. Life is&nbsp;inherently so including both good and bad with both good and evil want excellent color you&nbsp;want. God is the greatest innovator He created everything in the universe, all things in life. He&nbsp;created the pain so we know how to cherish happiness, create evil to know the good as good,&nbsp;created the evil to us that the cause is noble, create pests to know the price value of the pest&nbsp;species.</p>
<p class="font7">But throughout history there probably have had many people ask the question, if God is real, why does he not show up. We should understand that our current level of evolution is still very&nbsp;low, so if God present himself with any form humans also find it difficult to accept. Currently&nbsp;there are a lot of misconceptions about God, so if he appears in the flying saucer people will&nbsp;probably use rockets to destroy. And if he continues to appear in the form of the Jesus Christ,&nbsp;people will make sure to crucify him. Moreover, God is God, He does not need to present to&nbsp;anyone. There are also many people who asked if God is real, why does he let the world always&nbsp;immersed in deadly wars and crime everywhere, suffering everywhere. Better we should not ask&nbsp;God and ask why it is the way it is, the world is like today is because of the creative process and&nbsp;hard work of mankind. Better yet, we should ask ourselves what we have helped to build the&nbsp;society and the world. In addition, they wonder why God wanted the perfect man, but he also&nbsp;created the evil worse. If God created everything perfect, then maybe the world had never&nbsp;existed. If God created man perfect from the beginning, the man is not a human but a robot and&nbsp;the world will not evolve. Everything happens to us is because we created it, everything that&nbsp;happens in the world is created by all of us. All developments occurring in the world and is the&nbsp;process of social evolution, if we assume that the current world is not good so today everyone&nbsp;together to change certain future world would be better. Change is a product of evolution, people&nbsp;want better, better world to each of us all change together. Do not have anyone who can help me&nbsp;change if I do not want to change. So, the question of God really exists or not? it's hard to answer&nbsp;so reasonable and evolution is a process rather than God created evolution.</p>
<p class="font7">God can not make everything fine, can not create everything down in a way because if he did not conform to the natural law. But let's put that aside for God, to tell the story of humanity and selfassessment of what is good what is bad for example: scientist Alfred Nobel invented dynamite or&nbsp;scientists invent the theory of nuclear reactions. The nature of these inventions is neither good&nbsp;and evil, neither right and wrong, only when people choose to use it for the purposes of war, it&nbsp;becomes evil, if people just choose it to serve for human benefits, it becomes positive. For&nbsp;example, when scientists invented the laser, if people only used for medical purposes to save&nbsp;lives and serve the useful purpose of bringing the other, this is good invention. But people also&nbsp;applied it to create weapons, at this angle, the invention is indeed bad.</p>
<p class="font7">So God created man and woman, male and female, upper and lower, before and after, left and right, good and bad, right and wrong, virtue and evil. Everything that happens in nature there are&nbsp;no right or wrong, good or bad, good or evil, there is no honor or shame that all these things are&nbsp;identified and evaluated by human consciousness. A bird flying in the sky look us in their eyes of&nbsp;there is nothing right or wrong, good or bad, good or bad, but people can distinguish. People are&nbsp;aware of this by the human soul or, more accurately, human software program creative conscious&nbsp;of God and given to us.</p>
<p class="font7">In the eyes of the observer, God see nothing happens in life that is not necessary for a soul in the process of evolution. When we experience happiness, then we must know what to do to avoid&nbsp;misery. But when we experience pain, sometimes there is also a fortune, because it helps us&nbsp;appreciate the happiness and try to create more happiness. When we live in the icy winter, we&nbsp;cherish the warm summer days. Finally after much experience everything in life, through many&nbsp;lifetimes of being selected we will know what is the best way of life to perfect the process of&nbsp;growing spirituality and consciousness. God always have the highest sense of what he was doing,&nbsp;he seeks to bring us the best, but not always we know. In God's eyes there is no such thing as&nbsp;punishment, there is no such thing as bad karma that things happen just by the law of cause and&nbsp;effect, we will never perish but all then everyone will achieve highest wish eventually. All the&nbsp;things that today we are evil or sin does not lead us to hell and in fact never existed something&nbsp;called hell. Heaven and hell are the two terms from only one place does not do it just to say, the&nbsp;human way of thinking. We will never find heaven after death, we only really get it when we&nbsp;live, the people in a state of mind, spirit and body work together. But Heaven that day we will&nbsp;live in, not in some distant place, that's where. Whereas there are many who believe that after&nbsp;death the soul will of God, will go to heaven so we wonder what they think is true, in fact they&nbsp;are not wrong. Recalling what has been presented in Chapter 3, the moment we die God will&nbsp;retrieve our soul back to His kingdom, to prepare for the process of reincarnation. Therefore,&nbsp;their belief was true that after death the soul would go to heaven, but indeed even after we are&nbsp;saved, we do not have anyone living in the kingdom of God that we continue to live on this&nbsp;earth. But death is how we really dead? Truly death is a term to refer to a state where the soul left&nbsp;the body to look for opportunities to incarnate in a new body. In fact, we never die and our souls&nbsp;are immortal, death happens to the body, the soul will be temporarily suspended. But now there&nbsp;are not many people who believe in the human soul is real and immortal, not many people&nbsp;believe in reincarnation. God has revealed to me so many messages about this issue, through the&nbsp;violence of the religious order to the very real phenomena such as reincarnation past life memory&nbsp;and other evidence that each of us can sense, but we still do not believe it's true. We require&nbsp;scientific evidence to prove the fact, but try to ask whether there is a scientist convince us than&nbsp;our own self-proven and experience. Indeed we have experienced reincarnation too many&nbsp;problems, we also have to verify it within himself so many times. But human beings are&nbsp;inherently skeptical, so many people still do not believe in truth nothing more real, a fact can not&nbsp;be denied. In fact if we did not believe in the truth will be a disaster for us. Because when we do&nbsp;not believe in the immortal soul and reincarnation, that is, that when we die everything ends,&nbsp;from thinking so there are many people living despite long to achieve what you want, as long&nbsp;copy what you need. They will not need to live good, moral lives, they do not need compassion,&nbsp;not necessarily have pity interested in someone because they think that death is finished, who&nbsp;bother to spend fatigue. The current leaders do not believe in the immortal soul and rebirth they&nbsp;will lack motivation for world peace and make the world closer together, scientists do not believe&nbsp;they will lack motivation to study long-term projects, environmental activists do not believe will&nbsp;lack motivation to create projects to save the earth, etc.</p>
<p class="font7">Maybe we went a little too far, but if we do not take steps, we will not really understand the true meaning of fate, the importance of reincarnation. It is difficult to understand the meaning of the&nbsp;law of cause and effect and we can not determine God's intention for us in the future.</p>
<p class="font7">In short, the divine plan, God has set the operating rules for all life in the universe, including the laws of cause and effect is a law that reflects the all truth very effective and accurate. Today&nbsp;though we believe in fate or not, it does not matter much. But we can not believe the law of&nbsp;causality is true, that the law of causality is the father of fate. In fact the influence of the law of&nbsp;cause and effect is too large, so when it comes to the response of the law of cause and effect&nbsp;affects people, we have to use the word fate. God arranged for human destiny so natural, that we&nbsp;mistakenly believe everything happens to us is due to random chance, accidental coincidence.&nbsp;All good or bad results in fate are created by people in their past lives. God does not punish any&nbsp;one, he always treated fair with everyone. God and the angels shall maintain direct causal law&nbsp;absolutely fair to help humanity evolve. When operating the courses of events destined for&nbsp;people, all the angels must comply with the laws that God has set out not arbitrarily change (of&nbsp;course, the angels always aware of this). But with the infinite power of God, He can appear in&nbsp;many different forms on Earth and that He may reward or help for all those who try to live well&nbsp;and strive, by law grace without having to be based on fate. All our law anyone can enjoy the&nbsp;grace of God to overcome the initial fate if people are trying to change.</p>
<p><a name="bookmark81"></a><span class="font7">Fate is an important part of God's plan to expand and promote the evolution of life on a cosmic scale. Fate is an effective means God help maintain the law of karma and justice for all of life is&nbsp;not to be saved, not only for human life on Earth. Fate is a message of God to help people do&nbsp;good and avoid evil, since that would lead people to life immortality, complete freedom and&nbsp;enjoy the good things in the future.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark83"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark84"></a>MYSTERIES &amp; OTHER UNEXPLAINED</span></h1>
<h1><a name="bookmark85"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark86"></a>PHENOMENA</span></h1>
<p class="font7">In this chapter, we‘ll look into the following mysterious phenomena: prophecy, telepathy, mediumship, dreams, ghosts, near-death experiences, sixth sense, and fortune-telling and&nbsp;physiognomy.</p>
<h2><a name="bookmark87"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark88"></a>1. Prophecy</span></h2>
<p class="font7">A normal person can predict events which will happen in the future based on their understanding, analysis and calculation of information related to those events. However, most predictions&nbsp;typically do not have a high level of accuracy because there are a multitude of unpredicted&nbsp;factors.</p>
<p class="font7">To know exactly what will happen in one month, one day or even one hour is something that is impossible, except for prophets. A great prophet can predict many important events related to the&nbsp;world, a country, or an individual, and most of these events will happen exactly as foretold.</p>
<p class="font7">Prophecy is understood as knowing and fortelling matters that will happen in the future. A prophet is a person chosen by God to fulfill the task of informing people about what will happen&nbsp;in the future. Before becoming a prophet or a telepathist, one has to go through extreme physical&nbsp;or spiritual changes or both. Only then can one execute the tasks assigned by God. Prophets&nbsp;receive messages from God or the angels through superior brainwaves. At the appropriate time,&nbsp;God and the angels will send information, images or sound files into prophets‘ brains so that they&nbsp;can foretell. A prophet‘s mission is to deliver the message - all events will be executed by God&nbsp;and the angels. They use superior technological equipment from outer space to effect&nbsp;circumstances on Earth and affecting humans.</p>
<p class="font7">For example, angels send messages to prophets to foretell an earthquake which will happen at an accurate point in time. Because the angels know clearly about the Earth‘s structures and changes,&nbsp;the message sent to the prophet is highly accurate.</p>
<p class="font7">As another example, angels send messages to prophets to foretell the moment a catastrophe will happen in a country, who will be the next President, when a particular person will die, or whether&nbsp;a person will be successful or not. Although, people are warned in advance by prophets, all&nbsp;events still happen exactly as foretold - we can‘t stop these events from happening. Angels carry&nbsp;out these events based on the prearranged course of events of a country‘s destiny or a person‘s&nbsp;fate. The prophecy events related to the destiny of a country or an individual‘s fate can happen&nbsp;exactly as foretold.</p>
<p class="font7">Even an excellent prophet cannot foretell all events exactly, however, especially events related to humanity as a whole, such as World War III or worldwide disease epidemics. Whether these&nbsp;events happen or not depends much on humanity‘s morality and God‘s views towards us.&nbsp;Therefore, although there are messages angles transmited to the prophets so they can fortell, but&nbsp;those events did not happen.</p>
<p class="font7">In brief, prophets are individuals who receive messages from God and the angels to foretell the future.</p>
<p class="font7">Baba Vanga (1911- 1996) is an example of prophecy. Throughout her life she lived in the city of Petrich, Rupit, Bulgaria. When she was 12 year old, a strong tornado swept Vanga far away, then&nbsp;she was found alive among the rocks, she was blind since then. After the accident, Vanga has&nbsp;ability to predict many things accurately. Eventually she became the world‘s famous prophet.&nbsp;Many of her prophecies are still correct after she died.</p>
<p class="font7">Nostradamus (1503 - 1566) was born in the province St Remy, southern France. Nostradamus is one of the most famous prophets in human history. He is the author of The Les Prophecies which&nbsp;includes 1000 prophecies expressing in the form of poems. The majority of his prophecies&nbsp;happened as said.</p>
<h2><a name="bookmark89"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark90"></a>2. Telepathy</span></h2>
<p class="font7">Similar to prophets, telepathists also receive information from outside sources imposing on their brains; as a result, they become aware of certain information. However, prophets are assigned&nbsp;with more important assignments by God. Therefore, there are not many famous prophets, while&nbsp;there are many telepathists over the world.</p>
<p class="font7">All information telepathists receive is sent to them via super brainwaves by the angels. With this knowledge, telepathists can tell what happened in the past, see events happening at far-away&nbsp;places, and see what is inside the earth. They listen to the voice inside their brains.</p>
<p class="font7">Normally, a prophet‘s ability to prophesy lasts to the end of his life; however, in the case of a telepathists, there are few that hold on to their telepathy ability for the entire life. Usually, after a&nbsp;period of time the information they received will no longer be accurate, or they will no longer&nbsp;receive information from the angels. The information that telepathists receive is usually the&nbsp;information of the past.</p>
<p class="font7">Edgar Cayce (1877-1945) was born in the city of Hopkinsville, Kentucky. He is known for his ability to read past lives and diagnose medical problems for others when he‘s in sleeping state.&nbsp;He conducted 25,000 readings for people in the U.S. and around the world, in many cases he&nbsp;conducted readings remotely. There are 14,000 readings remains until today.</p>
<p class="font7">Phan Thi Bich Hang (born 1972) was born in Khanh Hoa, Yen Khanh, Ninh Binh, Vietnam. In 1988, she was bitten by a rabid dog and after the accident she had telepathy ability, helping many&nbsp;families look for the remains of loved ones lost in the war. During a period of 20 years she has&nbsp;found thousands of remains.</p>
<h2><a name="bookmark91"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark92"></a>3. Mediumship and Necromancy</span></h2>
<p class="font7">In the New Testament of the Bible, Jesus said: —Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.” God always responses to those who&nbsp;believe; those beliefs can be based on religion, or any faith. This means that when we pray to a&nbsp;deity, the deity always responds. Mediumship and necromancy are among the ways that angels&nbsp;respond to humans‘ entreaties. However, whether the angels give us what we ask for or not&nbsp;depend on our intentions and also our fate.</p>
<p class="font7">Unlike prophets and telepathists, a person when conducting mediumship (a medium) completely loses consciousness; all of his or her behaviors and words are totally controlled by the angels.&nbsp;The person is then become a medium for the angles to channel information.</p>
<p class="font7">For example, a person would like to call for the soul of Mr. A‘s. If angels accept, they will locate the information in the stored verson of Mr. A‘s RPLI. Then, angels make the medium lose&nbsp;consciousness with their superior technological equipment. The angels control his gestures, acts&nbsp;and words to mimic exactly Mr. A‘s when he was alive. Angels make voice sounds and answer&nbsp;all questions based on information extracted from Mr. A‘s RPLI saved in paradise.</p>
<p class="font7">Because of these phenomena, we still misunderstand the fact that the soul has non-material life after death. Having said that, is it still necessary for us to worship and pray to our deceased&nbsp;relatives when we know that our relatives‘ souls have already incarnated into new life long ago?&nbsp;A person who performs mediumship on a regular basis can easily damage his neuron system,&nbsp;because each time this happens, the angels anaesthetize him using super brainwaves. If a person&nbsp;performs mediumship too many times, he can become mentally ill or die. In short, soul is real,&nbsp;but soul does not actually —get into” the medium; it is due to angles controlling him or her with&nbsp;their superior technological equipment.</p>
<h2><a name="bookmark93"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark94"></a>4. Dreams</span></h2>
<p class="font7">Dreaming is a phenomenon that everyone experiences. There are some dreams that reflect our wishes; other dreams take us to completely strange places. Yet there are dreams that are repeated&nbsp;in life, and some dreams that foretell the future. We can categorize dreams into 3 types: dreams&nbsp;from the subconscious, dreams from the RPLI and dreams that foretell the future.</p>
<h3><a name="bookmark95"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark96"></a>Dreams From the Subconscious</span></h3>
<p class="font7">Dreams from the subconscious reflect the needs of the human psychophysiology, wishes, or worries in daily life.</p>
<p class="font7">For example, when we are young, our body control ability has not matured. Thus, when a child drinks too much water, he‘ll dream of peeing, and as a result he will wet his bed. When the child&nbsp;grows up, the developed body and curiosity about sexual desire result in dreams of making love,&nbsp;which makes him ejaculate.</p>
<p class="font7">As another example, a person who starves frequently will dream eating favorite foods. A person in love often dreams about his lover. An escaped criminal with a worried state of mind will&nbsp;dream of being caught. A person who is interested in one thing will dream of doing that thing.</p>
<p class="font7">Dreams similar to those above happen frequently in life because of calculation, worries, and desires that make up a great part of our daily thinking. When we sleep, they easily appear in our&nbsp;dreams.</p>
<h3><a name="bookmark97"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark98"></a>Dreams From the RPLI</span></h3>
<p class="font7">The RPLI has saved information about our lives. It includes beautiful memories, painful changes, and terrible accidents that happened in the past. In the present, a person has a peaceful and happy&nbsp;life without any worries; he will have beautiful dream conveying images in the past. Conversely,&nbsp;if one has difficulties and worries, he will often have dreams of bad things which happened in&nbsp;previous lives. All of these dreams are from the RPLI.</p>
<p class="font7">For example, a person with a pleasant life dreams of wandering in a field of fresh, green grass with a beautiful woman, and this dream repeats many times. This is because in his previous life&nbsp;he had great love with this woman, and those images are deeply engraved in his RPLI.</p>
<p class="font7">As another example, a person has many worries in his life. He always dreams of being drowned, and this dream repeats many times. This is because in his previous lives there was at least once&nbsp;when he died of terrible drowning. People often claim that those are nightmares which warn&nbsp;them about bad things that will happen in the future. In reality, these dreams do not have much&nbsp;impact on our current life.</p>
<p class="font7">Another example: In a dream we meet some strange people, as well as some acquaintances in a place that is neither strange nor familiar. This phenomenon is due to information extracted from&nbsp;the RPLI which has appeared at the same time as information extracted from the subconscious,&nbsp;creating a dream of mixed images.</p>
<h3><a name="bookmark99"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark100"></a>Dreams That Foretell The Future</span></h3>
<p class="font7">In our lives, some people have dreams and their meanings foretell what will happen in the future. This can be a good or a bad warning to themselves or for their relatives. These dreams are not&nbsp;from the subconscious or the RLPI; this type of dreams is sent by angels. When angels want to&nbsp;inform someone of something in advance, they create a file of information and, via super&nbsp;brainwave, they send it to that person’s central brain to create a dream. Usually, the dreamer&nbsp;suddenly wakes right after the dream ends; thus, he can remember details from the dream very&nbsp;clearly. In these dreams, information and events are very clear and decisive - not vague, like&nbsp;other types of dreams.</p>
<p class="font7">A person with surplus —account” (good morals) usually has this kind of dream. Angels create dreams to inform people of bad news or good news which will happen in the future.</p>
<p class="font7">To better understand the meaning of dreams, we first need to know how to classify our dreams. If dreams come from the subconscious or RLPI, we don‘t need to pay much attention. But if we&nbsp;identify a dream as one that foretells the future, we should try to understand the message in the&nbsp;dream. It‘s not always easy to understand the meaning of dreams. Sometimes, we have to&nbsp;analyze a dream‘s details in order to decode the message sent by angels. These details can be&nbsp;sights, time, symbols, and meanings of names of people in the dream.</p>
<p class="font7">For an example, when one has a dream about fighting with others, it is a warning about losing money. On the other hand, when one has a dream about other people fighting one another, it is&nbsp;asign of receiving money. In dreams, playing chess with another is a warning of having troubles,&nbsp;but on the other hand, seeing others playing chess is a sign of things going smoothly in your life.</p>
<p class="font7">When a person has a dream about a fish swimming freely in the ocean, this is a good sign. On the other hand, dreaming of fish swimming in a pool foretells an unsuccessful event coming up. The&nbsp;smaller the pool is, the more challenging the event is.</p>
<p class="font7">These are just a few examples. There are clear dreams, but there are some that are mysterious. Therefore, personal experience and habits are necessary in order to extract the meaning of&nbsp;dreams and use them to predict events in the future.</p>
<h2><a name="bookmark101"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark102"></a>5. The Sixth Sense (Extrasensory Perception)</span></h2>
<p class="font7">To better understand the sixth sense, we first need to differentiate the sixth sense from intuition. Intuition initiates from the RPLI and there must be leading information from five senses. People&nbsp;who have strong sense of intuition to process tasks or when communicating with others are&nbsp;among the people that live many lives. For example, when someone can often make decisions&nbsp;within a glance</p>
<p class="font7">In our life, each of us has at least once felt the intuition about something. Intuition is a frequent phenomenon for everyone, but each person‘s intuitive ability is different. Sometimes we feel&nbsp;nervous, worried, or angry without any reason, and we don‘t feel right. Then we lose money, fail,&nbsp;have accidents or meet unexpected troubles. Sometimes we suddenly feel unreasonable or&nbsp;uncontrolled sadness when we were enjoying a pleasant life, and then we hear that our relatives&nbsp;have had accidents.</p>
<p class="font7">The above phenomenon is considered to be part of our sixth sense. When these psychological conditions appear, we feel that something wrong is going to happen, but we can‘t prevent those&nbsp;events from happening, as they are prearranged.</p>
<p class="font7">For an example, Englishman Winston Churchill was famous for his intuitive ability. In 1941, after checking an aircraft team, Churchill came back to his car. Unexpectedly, he refused to site&nbsp;the seat his officer had recommended. He passed by the opened front door and sat in the back.&nbsp;Right after that, a bomb exploded in front of the car, causing the officer sitting in the front seat to&nbsp;die instantly. Another time, in a bomb attack from the German army, Churchill saved the lives of&nbsp;a whole team of cooks. He ordered everyone to go down to the basement right before the kitchen&nbsp;was hit by a bomb.</p>
<p class="font7">The phenomena are caused by angels affecting our consciousness via super brainwave transmitted from their superior technological equipment. In the case of the general, his fate was&nbsp;not yet at an end, and his destiny was great; thus, angels sent a file of information directly into&nbsp;his brain, which directed him and saved his life.</p>
<h2><a name="bookmark103"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark104"></a>6. Ghosts</span></h2>
<p class="font7">Ghosts are a controversial topic everywhere in the world. Are ghosts real? Many people believe ghosts are not real, but others confirm that ghosts are real because they have witnessed these&nbsp;phenomena. We will find out whether the phenomena are real or not.</p>
<p class="font7">Ghosts are similar to other spiritual phenomena, which all remain mysterious. Scientists want to research and experiment with this phenomenon, but when scientists prepare equipment to verify,&nbsp;this phenomenon does not happen. As we know, all human actions and thoughts come from the&nbsp;brain, and all of these activities are watched by God and the angels via super brainwave;&nbsp;scientists are no exception. Thus, when seeing humans taking actions to check these events,&nbsp;angels instantly stop what they are doing. Therefore, it is hard for man to find out the truth unless&nbsp;the angels permit it. Furthermore, our scientific technology is very primitive in comparison to&nbsp;theirs; thus, our search is challenging. Ghost phenomena often appear at night due to two&nbsp;reasons: • First, angels often create ghost images at night because the dark makes humans feel&nbsp;easily thrilled and scared. • Second, it is easier for angels to create ghost images at night, because&nbsp;during the day it is harder to create these optical images due to sunlight.</p>
<p class="font7">Besides using the superior optical technology to create ghost images, angels also use anti-gravity technology to move objects in space, and use super advanced sound wave technology to make&nbsp;noises such as crying and screaming with projected ghost images. To deceive humans more&nbsp;persuasively, angels often let ghosts appear at holy or gloomy places, or where someone died.</p>
<p class="font7">In brief, ghost phenomena are real, but can also be considered not real because they are all illusions created by angels with their scientific technology. Therefore, there is no reason to be&nbsp;scared of ghosts.</p>
<h2><a name="bookmark105"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark106"></a>7. Precognition Studies: Fortune-Telling and Physiognomy</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark107"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark108"></a>Fortune-Telling</span></h3>
<p class="font7">Most prediction science subjects originate in the Eastern world, with the exception of astrology, which came from the Western world. It is difficult for us to identify who the author of fortune&nbsp;telling methods was, because it has appeared since ancient times, became popular in Medieval&nbsp;times, and still exists until now. When time goes by, people learned through their experiences&nbsp;and add more materials to make this art more perfect.</p>
<p class="font7">Some people say that fortune-telling is superstitious, but others believe it as a scientific subject. In reality, many people recognize the accuracy of the practice when they approach fortune-telling&nbsp;subjects such as astrology, horoscope, etc. From there, they can apply it in their lives, bringing&nbsp;about many benefits. But not everyone benefits from fortune-telling; it is not accurate for some&nbsp;of people because they are new souls. New souls who are living their first life don‘t have fate&nbsp;yet.</p>
<p class="font7">A good specialist in this area can predict a person‘s future exactly using the person‘s exact date and time of birth. But we know that human fates are prearranged by God based on the deeds of&nbsp;each person in their previous life. Thus, stars and planets are just symbols with meaning&nbsp;according to a prearranged program used to interpret a horoscope. Besides, symbols do not play&nbsp;any role in affecting us. In fact, all fortune-telling methods are created with the help of God and&nbsp;angels which, based on fate, help us to know our fate in advance.</p>
<p class="font7">Each fortune-telling form has its own prediction method. For example, horoscope is based on date and time of birth on the lunar calendar. Astrology is based on the western calendar. Human&nbsp;fate is prearranged, so angels just adjust the date and time of birth of each person‘s birth before&nbsp;he‘s born to be relevant with a good or bad horoscope, matching with the stars on the twelve&nbsp;signs of the Chinese Zodiac master.</p>
<p class="font7">A good astrologer, horoscope, the four pillars, etc. are able to predict quite accurately the fate and destiny of each individual. But to predict the future destiny of a nation or the world is likely&nbsp;impossible. We already know that even the destiny of a nation or the world must also be&nbsp;determined based on the law of righteousness. In other words, when God set future destiny for a&nbsp;nation, he also rely on morality of the country, and for the world, he is based on the morality of&nbsp;humankind. But unfortunately we can not know how many years God bases on to arrange a term&nbsp;for national destiny and whether the time is synchronous or not between nations. We also do not&nbsp;know how many years God arranged a term of fate of the world. For this reason, we can not&nbsp;accurately predict the future of a country or the world. In addition to the destiny God can decide&nbsp;many things will happen to humankind from many thousands of years according to a&nbsp;predetermined plan, but those are the —unrevealed God‘s works” we can not know beforehand.</p>
<h3><a name="bookmark109"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark110"></a>Physiognomy</span></h3>
<p class="font7">Physiognomy is based on using outward appearance to foretell a person‘s fate. The human‘s appearance could be rich, poor, miserable, beautiful, ugly, etc. Information can be conveyed by&nbsp;parts of the body, such as the eyes, nose, mouth, forehead, hands, legs, chin, walking styles,&nbsp;voice, and even moles and fingerprints. God let this information conveyed to match with each&nbsp;person‘s fate. Appearance is almost always due to heredity, but when God lets a soul reincarnate,&nbsp;he has already chosen a suitable place for that soul. A good physiognomy master can predict a&nbsp;person‘s future destiny exactly, just based on information conveyed by his body - except for&nbsp;people with new souls.</p>
<p class="font7">Although our fate cannot be changed in our current life, God still lets us know our future in advance through many forms of fortune-telling. Knowing our fate in advance helps humans not&nbsp;to pursue desires that exceed their fate. Knowing it in advance helps humans adjust desires and&nbsp;avoid making mistakes with unexpected failures. Knowing it in advance, humans will accept the&nbsp;truth easier and create for themselves a remarkable life with in their fate.</p>

<h1><a name="bookmark112"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark113"></a>THE LAST JUDGEMENT DAY</span></h1>
<h2><a name="bookmark114"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark115"></a><a name="bookmark116"></a>1. The End of the World Day</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font7">1. Many people assume that the final judgment day is the same as the end of the world day,&nbsp;but these two notions are completely different. —End of the world” means the last day of the&nbsp;earth, the day when everything on earth is destroyed: trees, houses, humans, and even Earth&nbsp;itself no longer exists. Everything will end. But we completely believe that God will not let&nbsp;this day happen due to the following reasons:</p></li><li>
<p class="font7">2. God created the solar system and life on Earth, which are included in His divine plan. In&nbsp;His plans, God created many lives and connected them together in the whole universe. Thus,&nbsp;God will not let the end of the world day happen. If the end of the world day happened, this&nbsp;would defeat God‘s purpose.</p></li><li>
<p class="font7">3. In the past 4.5 billion years, God and the angels have made a lot of efforts to create things&nbsp;which bring life to humans. His great intention is to lead humans to evolve both intellectually&nbsp;and spiritually in order to have immortal life. Thus, God will not let end of the world day&nbsp;happen.</p></li><li>
<p class="font7">4. God is merciful. All suffering is caused by man from the sins of man, not by God to&nbsp;punish. He always loves, not hate or seek revenge with us. Thus, we know that human sins&nbsp;are not a reason for God to get angry, to wipe out humankind and destroy his own plan.</p></li></ul>
<p class="font7">Since the beginning of time, there have been many rumors and predictions about the end of the word day - for instance, in 1666 and 1999. Currently, there are some predictions about the end of&nbsp;the world on December 21, 2012, the last day of the Mayan calendar cycle and probably more of&nbsp;those rumors will come. However, based upon the explanation above, we can conclude that end&nbsp;of the world will never happen.</p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark117"></a>2. The Last Judgment Day</span></h2>
<p class="font7">The final judgment day is good news for humanity. This day was mentioned in both the Bible and the Qur‘an. However, information about the events of this day is only vaguely described in&nbsp;various religions.</p>
<p class="font7">As we know, after death a soul will be seized by God, and before incarnating back to life again, all souls have to be judged for good and bad deeds from the previous life in order to receive fate&nbsp;arrangement. However, the meaning of the judgment day in question is not the same as previous&nbsp;judgments; this is God‘s final judgment, without distinguishing between religious and nonreligious followers, theistic or atheistic; this is judgment for all of humanity.</p>
<p class="font7">Before humans can be liberated from death and reincarnation, each individual has to improve himself. As a part of this, God will especially take into consideration two very important factors:&nbsp;morality and knowledge. Although these two factors have the same importance level, they are&nbsp;ranked differently by God on the last judgment day.</p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">When God judges morality and dignity, he will only judge for each individual, not based&nbsp;on the general morality of humanity.</span></p></li><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">When God judges knowledge or civilization level, he will base this judgment on the&nbsp;overall level of whole world - not on each individual.</span></p></li></ul>
<p class="font7">The reason for this difference in God‘s judgment process is due to the fact that intellect is something that God gives humans at each period of time in order to meet living and human&nbsp;developmental needs. On the other hand, morality and dignity belong to an individual‘s efforts to&nbsp;improve and reach a level of perfection according to God‘s standards.</p>
<p class="font7">For God to decide the time of the final judgment day, humans need to reach a certain evolutionary level and synchronicity of both intellect and morality - again, according to&nbsp;standards set by God. We know God does not just let us evolve by ourselves, from the&nbsp;beginning; God and the angels have helped us a lot.</p>
<p class="font7">In the intellectual field, God helped humans in many direct and indirect ways, such as:</p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">In the early days that humans existed on Earth, the angels distributed humankind so that&nbsp;humans appeared all over the world. They directly taught each group a language so that we&nbsp;can communicate with one another.</span></p></li><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">God and the angels helped humans indirectly by revelation. For an example, the Russian&nbsp;Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev established the first version of the periodic table of elements in&nbsp;a dream.</span></p></li><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">God and the angels helped humans directly and indirectly by installing new knowledge&nbsp;into RLPI and then releasing geniuses into the world. Examples include physicist-astronomer&nbsp;Albert Einstein and German composer Ludwig Van Beethoven.</span></p></li></ul>
<p class="font7">In morality and dignity, God helped humans through many direct and indirect ways, such as:</p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">As an indirect form of assistance, God helped Gautama Buddha create Buddhism and&nbsp;helped Confucius create Confucianism, Martin Luther, John Calvin to create Protestant&nbsp;Church, and other great philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.</span></p></li><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">As a half direct / half indirect form of assistance, God revealed messages to the prophet&nbsp;Abraham, who then created Judaism. By way of revelation, God helped the prophet&nbsp;Muhammad create Islam. By mediumship and channeling he helped a group of Vietnamese&nbsp;people create Caodaism.</span></p></li><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">As a direct form of assistance, God let his son, Jesus Christ, borrowing an earthly human&nbsp;body, come to Earth to help create Christianity.</span></p></li></ul>
<p class="font7">In brief, on the last judgment day God may not release some scientists or talented business owners, due to their poor morality, but he may liberatea craftsman or a famer because they have&nbsp;very good morality.</p>
<h2><a name="bookmark118"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark119"></a>3. Preparation for the Last Judgment Day</span></h2>
<p class="font7">God will not predetermine the last judgement daybecause this process will depend on the evolutional level of humanity as a whole. Humansare a significant factor contributing to the&nbsp;progressof the last judgment day. God will execute many steps for thelast judgement day, as&nbsp;followed:</p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font7">1. First, God will set and inform the exact date of the last judgement day to all humankind.</p></li><li>
<p class="font7">2. Second, God will let all souls kept in heaven incarnate into human form18 years prior to&nbsp;the final judgment day so that they all canbe mature enough to attend the final judgment day.&nbsp;This work of God can be considered to fulfill the statement —death is alive from the grave” to&nbsp;attend the final judgment day (Revelation 20:13).</p></li><li>
<p class="font7">3. Third, during the waiting time of the last judgement day, God will not let anyone die, and&nbsp;simultaneously will not let anyone have babies.</p></li><li>
<p class="font7">4. &nbsp;Finally, God, Jesus Christ and high-level angels will come to earth to process the&nbsp;judgment.</p></li></ul>
<p class="font7">There are two ways that God and angels will come to Earth:</p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">First way: God will inform some scientists on Earth to prepare some clone humans&nbsp;according to his requirement. When the final judgment day will come, God, Jesus Christ and&nbsp;the angels will possess these bodies by super brainwave, similar to the way Jesus Christ&nbsp;descended to earth 2000 years ago.</span></p></li><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">Second way: the angels prepare clone bodies from their own orignal cells in outer space.&nbsp;When the final judgment comes, God, Jesus Christ and the angels will possess these bodies&nbsp;by super brainwaves and come to earth in flying saucers.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark120"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark121"></a>4. Methods of Judgment</span></h2>
<p class="font7">In the final judgment day, we will not see all of the people of the world coming to one place to hear God‘s judgement, because there is no place large enough forall of us to attend this event. On&nbsp;this day, angels will directly broadcast to the whole world the view where God, Jesus Christ and&nbsp;the angels perform the judgment. Those images, which the angels will execute through the use of&nbsp;superior optical technology and sound, will be seen in the clouds(Revelation, 1:7).</p>
<p class="font7">On that day, God will judge everyone - from a new soul who is in his first life to souls that had been though hundreds of lives. Everyone has equal chance.</p>
<p class="font7">This is the event that is mentionedin the —Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard”(New Testament, Mathew 20:1-15). In this parable, Jesus Christ compared each working hour to a life.</p>
<p class="font7">After preparing everything, God will announce the judgment and guide the angels to fulfill His judgment by using super brainwaves to activate the RLPI for everyone at the same time. From&nbsp;there, each of us will see and recall thoughts, actions and emotions, from the first life to the last&nbsp;one. This information will show in our heads with clear imagery and sound, as if we are&nbsp;watching a 3D movie. From there, each of us will be aware of what we have done in the past:&nbsp;good or bad, virtue or sin, all is shown clearly so that we cannot deny it. After the self-judgment,&nbsp;God will make a list of deserved people who can receive his release. These people will be&nbsp;released from fate, escape reincarnation and enjoy immortal lives.</p>
<p class="font7">The rest who are not released by God in this judgment will have their physical lives taken away, but their souls will be saved. However, God will not take away the lives of these souls forever.&nbsp;He will let them incarnate into human form and live on a different planet, created after Earth.&nbsp;God will not let these souls incarnate into the first humans of the new planet. Instead, He will&nbsp;choose the right moment so that these souls’ knowledge will match the civilization at that place.&nbsp;This will help these souls to continue to evolve and wait for the final judgment day of that planet.&nbsp;This work of God was mentioned as releasing Satan after —first a thousand-year imprisonment”&nbsp;(Revelation 20:1-10). We know that God has ultimate power. Thus, there is no one who can&nbsp;oppose Him. Therefore, Satan was not on the opposite side. He was a high-level angel under&nbsp;God’s leading. Angel Satan and others will be responsible for managing human virtue and sin.&nbsp;And Satan Angel will be responsible for managing sins. Therefore, Satan is considered the&nbsp;symbol of all sins. We should understand that Satan is imprisoned in hell are also the soul of sin&nbsp;is not to be saved and no other Satan.</p>
<p class="font7">Once again, the consideration of these events will help us know that the soul is immortal and God is good-hearted and absolutely fair. He never gets rid of any souls. Even though they have&nbsp;done many evil deeds, he will still continuously guide them to the end.</p>
<h2><a name="bookmark122"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark123"></a>5. After the Final Judgment Day</span></h2>
<p class="font7">After judgment, God will activates super brain wave system to connect with our RPLI and consciousness and became one, from which we can recall all the facts have occurred in all lives&nbsp;that we have experienced. In addition, God will adjust our gene so that it becomes the most&nbsp;perfect and give us the secret operation of the super-brain waves and gene structure so humans&nbsp;can create our own beautiful and youthful body as desired. At the same time, God will empower&nbsp;Jesus Christ and high-level angels to manage work on Earth. The first thing Jesus will do is to&nbsp;become the master of ceremonies for couples’ who will live together on Earth in the future.</p>
<p class="font7">After the judgment, humans will not continue to have children because it is no longer necessary for a life that everyone live forever. humans can live in an absolutely fair and peaceful society.</p>
<p class="font7">At that time, all material products for serving humanity’s needs and all services will be produced and managed mostly by robots and biological robots.</p>
<p class="font7">After the judgment, Jesus Christ will lead and guide us in helping souls and lives that form after Earth. We will do work similar to what angels used to do to support us as humans. At that time,&nbsp;we will also become angels for those humans living at different places.</p>

<h1><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark125"></a><a name="bookmark126"></a>POPULATION, KNOWLEDGE &amp; FUTURE TECHNOLOGY</span></h1>
<h2><a name="bookmark127"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark128"></a>1. The Remarkable Points of Science and Technology</span></h2>
<p class="font7">We cannot deny that scientific technology is an extremely necessary field for human evolution and development. In ancient times, humans used to apply scientific technology in their daily&nbsp;lives, but scientific technology has progressed greatly within the last 100 years. There are two&nbsp;main reasons to explain why the progress of science development on Earth not occurs in&nbsp;synchronicity.</p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">Overpopulation: As we know, in the 1800s the world population was only one billion&nbsp;people, but recently it has increased to seven billion. Two hundred and ten years is only&nbsp;about 1/60 of the total time that modern humans have existed on the planet, but the&nbsp;population rate has increased nearly 700% in that time, which is an extremely fast growth&nbsp;rate.</span></p></li><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">Moral evolution: Human evolution consists of many factors, but the evolution of morality&nbsp;and personal behavior is the most important. In general, the people become more civilized&nbsp;and develop higher awareness, the more the respect the law and behave humanely. Social&nbsp;relationships and relations between nations also become more equal, etc.</span></p></li></ul>
<p class="font7">Overpopulation is an important reason for God to judge whether to equip or not to equip humanity with new knowledge, but morality plays an even more important role.</p>
<p class="font7">Let‘s try a little calculation. If the population was seven billion people 1000 years ago, would humanity have survived? If this had been the case, it would have been difficult for us to live&nbsp;because at that time civilization and scientific technology was quite undeveloped. We were less&nbsp;knowledgeable about manufacturing in agriculture, industry, energy, transportation, technical&nbsp;construction, medicine, infrastructure, etc. Everything was primitive, so it would have been hard&nbsp;to meet the needs of all seven billion people. Conversely, if humans at that time had possessed&nbsp;our current scientific technology—and in particular atomic, chemical and biological weapons, it&nbsp;maybe not have been a good thing. At that time, a wealthy nation might start an invasion which&nbsp;was not controlled by any organization, simply based on the king‘s greed.</p>
<p class="font7">In brief, before God equipped humans with the intellect to meet the living needs of overpopulation, He examined whether man had enough morality to receive that knowledge or&nbsp;not. In case humanity does not possess high science and technology but does have good morality,&nbsp;the world will still live in peace and happiness. However, if humanity possesses high science and&nbsp;technology but low level of morality, obviously the world will not be peaceful anymore and may&nbsp;bring about its own destruction.</p>
<p class="font7">As we know, many geniuses in different fields have appeared all over the world for many centuries. However, geniuses with great intellects in scientific technology have only appeared in&nbsp;recent times. The increase of the world population goes well with high science and technology&nbsp;development. But the appearance of geniuses and scientists is not matched with the population of&nbsp;each continent, area or country. The appearance of geniuses in each nation depends on God‘s&nbsp;decision. God calculates so that after geniuses are born they work effectively and transmit&nbsp;received knowledge to human beings.</p>
<h2><a name="bookmark129"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark130"></a>2. The Era of Blooming Intellectual Development</span></h2>
<p class="font7">As we know, Africa was the cradle of all mankind, but Europe was the cradle of scientific technology. In the Renaissance and the succeeding centuries, Europe had many geniuses in&nbsp;different fields, such as literature, physics, chemistry, biology, etc. Talented scientists in Europe&nbsp;initiated progressive scientific technology, which led to the foundation of science of our current&nbsp;world.</p>
<p class="font7">Why did most geniuses appear only in Europe in that era, and not distributed equally on all continents? There are two reasons that explain this geographic phenomenon:</p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font7">1. Protestant Reformation: This was a movement that emerged in the 16th century as an&nbsp;effort to reform the Roman Catholic Church. This movement emerged with the 95 topics of&nbsp;Martin Luther, and this ideology was developed by John Calvin. The Protestant Reformation&nbsp;was a premise to help citizens in some European countries, such as England, France,&nbsp;Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, etc., and was foundation on which to reform the thought&nbsp;processes of citizens of European countries to object to the power of bishops and the&nbsp;ecclesiastical structure of the Roman Catholic Church. Gradually, this movement exceeded&nbsp;the traditional limit, doing away with unnecessary rituals. Its focus on personal freedoms led&nbsp;to the democratic process, helped humans assimilate within society and strongly fostered&nbsp;manufacturing and the spirit of work. The Protestant Reformation had a positive effect on&nbsp;science, expressed clearly in the following typical cases: Galileo Galilee was born on&nbsp;February 15th 1565 and died on January 8th 1642. He was an Italian astronomer, physicist&nbsp;and mathematician. Isaac Newton was born on January 4th 1643 and died on March 31st&nbsp;1727. He was an English physicist, astronomer and mathematician. These two talented&nbsp;scientists appeared in the same historical period. However, Galileo lived and worked in Italy,&nbsp;so his scientific career was limited by the Roman Catholic Church. On the other hand, Isaac&nbsp;Newton lived and worked in England. Thus, he was not restricted by religion as Galileo was.&nbsp;He was completely free in his scientific research, and his works were very useful for human&nbsp;beings.</p></li><li>
<p class="font7">2. Climate: Europe has a continental temperate climate. This climate occurs naturally, and&nbsp;brings about many benefits for man. It was not coincidence that the races lucky to live in&nbsp;these temperate climate areas are now most of the world‘s developed countries, such as the&nbsp;United States, Canada, England, France, Germany, Russia, the Netherlands, China, Korea&nbsp;and Japan. It was also not coincidence that all G8 countries belong to this geographic group&nbsp;with temperate climates. Finally, it was not coincidence that scientists in these countries were&nbsp;awarded Nobel prizes at a very high rate, especially the United States.</p></li></ul>
<p class="font7">Climatic factors seemed to be a very normal thing, not related to the occurrence of the talent and the development of a country. But we should know that the climate is a very important factor and&nbsp;sustainable factor for knowledge leading to the development of the country and the world. So for&nbsp;those who live and work in a temperate environment, their brains develop better and far more&nbsp;effective than those who live in tropical</p>
<p class="font7">The brains of those who live and work in temperate climates develop better and work more effectively than those who live in tropical zones. For example:</p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font7">1. People with similar levels of knowledge often work in the same study fields. But Mr.&nbsp;Aworks in 20 C temperature and Mr. B works in 37 C temperature. Obviously, Mr. A‘s&nbsp;performance is much higher than Mr. B‘s.</p></li><li>
<p class="font7">2. On summer days with high temperatures, mental patients get crazier than they do on&nbsp;winter days due to the effect that the outside temperature has on their brains. High&nbsp;temperatures make brains works less effectively. 20 C is the temperature most suitable for&nbsp;human brain development and operation(20°C was also the temperature inside the Gisa&nbsp;pyramid which was created by the angels to live and work in when on Earth).</p></li></ul>
<p class="font7">In brief, with these two important factors combined, after the Protestant Reformation period, God equipped many geniuses born in Europe with great intellects. In recent years, there have been&nbsp;many talented scientists appearing all over the world, and this is due to two reasons.</p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">First: Nowadays, in most countries all over the world religions do not have much&nbsp;influence over strategies, policies and the legitimacy the nation. Contemporary religions&nbsp;primary focus on guiding humans spiritually. Daily activities do not depend on rituals and&nbsp;religious dogmas. Therefore, despite the fact that modern humans have religious beliefs, they&nbsp;not bound heavily on religious laws (Protestant Reformation is an example). The more&nbsp;practical one lives, one strive more to work and achieve success in life.</span></p></li><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">Second: Scientific technology has improved the human lifestyle, and air conditioners&nbsp;have become useful tools in tropical countries. Air conditioners really help improve the&nbsp;living environments of these countries, as well as their working, learning and studying&nbsp;environments.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark131"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark132"></a>3. The Effects of Overpopulation</span></h2>
<p class="font7">The increase in the world population has great meaning for both humans and God. In early days, God encouraged humans to reproduce (Old Testament Bible, Book of Genesis 1:28).</p>
<p class="font7">World overpopulation was the primary reason for God to equip humans with the knowledge necessary to develop scientific technology, which subsequently served daily life. In reality, all&nbsp;good and bad things have their limitations, and overpopulation is no exception. In ancient times,&nbsp;there were less humans on Earth—thus, God encouraged man to reproduce to increase the&nbsp;population. But if the population increases without control, in the long term this will bring about&nbsp;unexpected disadvantages.</p>
<p class="font7">For example: the world, in the time of 2000 years ago, is compared to a construction site that were seriously in short of laborers, which need to have lots of human sources in order to&nbsp;maintain progress. But if continuing to recruit more workers as before (overpopulation), this&nbsp;could cause the construction site to go bankrupt.</p>
<p class="font7">Recently, there has been no group or scientist who has studied to predict how many people can live on Earth sustainably. We do not know when God will decide to enact the final judgment—&nbsp;maybe in 500 years, or 5000 years, or more. It cannot happen soon though. So if humans&nbsp;continue to reproduce at their current rate, at the end of 22nd century the world population will&nbsp;be approximately 20 billion people, and imagine how many people there will be in the 30th&nbsp;century!</p>
<p class="font7">Though we can‘t predict the exact day of the final judgment, we can still guess what will happen on this day. The more crowded the world population is, the less man can be released by God.&nbsp;The more man exists, the higher the standard of selection will be. How many people God will&nbsp;release in the future is not known for sure. After release, humans will be immortal and enjoy&nbsp;heavenly lives consisting of many factors, and space will be the most important.</p>
<p class="font7">If humans live in a tiny city, in crowded high rise apartments and with a high density population, these conditions are not conducive to a perfect life. Humans need to live with nature. Beautiful&nbsp;sights and romantic rivers are part of an enjoyable life. Therefore, an overcrowded world&nbsp;population will not meet these needs. In the future, if humanity maintains its current population&nbsp;growth, maybe God will adjust and cut the supply of new souls for humans. He will adjust by&nbsp;making people infertile or spreading epidemic diseases such as HIV as a warning against the&nbsp;abuse of sex. Later, there may appear many kinds of viruses, much more horrific than HIV,&nbsp;which will be brought to Earth by angels from outer space. Also, God could bring about disasters&nbsp;and other deadly things to balance the world population. In fact, God does not give humans bad&nbsp;things as mentioned above, that humans must take the consequences of their own choices.</p>
<p class="font7">Therefore, from now on, we must limit the growth of our population. Otherwise, we will have many troubles in sustaining life for humankind, and may harm ourselves through many&nbsp;unexpected events.</p>
<p class="font7">Each of us has to die, but there is no forever death. All souls are reincarnated continuously, until the final judgment day when they will enjoy perfect and immortal life. Therefore, we should not&nbsp;try to reproduce, as this can be harmful for us.</p>
<h2><a name="bookmark133"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark134"></a>4. Future Scientific Technology</span></h2>
<p class="font7">Although we currently possess quite advanced scientific technology, compared to the advanced lives in universe, especially in the place where God resides, our technology level is still very&nbsp;limited. Humans appeared on Earth more than 10,000 years ago, but this is a short period&nbsp;compared to the lives that existed before us. If humans want to achieve evolutionary levels equal&nbsp;to these other beings, we need much more time.</p>
<p class="font7">In the future, if man wants to reach immoral life in the perfect world, we will have to possess three technologies: gravitational waves, anti-gravity waves and super brainwaves.</p>
<h2><a name="bookmark135"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark136"></a>5. Gravitational Waves and Anti-Gravity Waves</span></h2>
<p class="font7">A gravitational wave is capable of creating high speeds so that objects can move in space. An anti-gravity wave is capable of controlling the gravity of all objects in the universe. After&nbsp;humans search out and possess this technology, we will manufacture flying saucers and operate&nbsp;them in the same manner as the angels, who travel the universe and skies of Earth in flying&nbsp;saucer. With our current technology, even if we try hard, we cannot travel further than our solar&nbsp;system. Owning flying saucer, however, man can easily travel into space and discover distant&nbsp;planets in far-off galaxies. Besides flying saucers, we will also create many other modes of&nbsp;transportation to replace motorbikes, cars, trains and planes. In the future, one popular form of&nbsp;transportation will be equipment which can cover the body like angel wings in fairy tales. This&nbsp;equipment will take man to space with appropriate speed and height based on the users‘ control.</p>
<p class="font7">In the future, these technologies will replace heavy transportation means such as the cranes and derricks that we currently use. These new means will work effectively, just as those with which&nbsp;angels moved big stones and built the Egyptian pyramids, in addition to other ancient&nbsp;architectural works. In brief, man will use supreme technology to serve mankind and support our&nbsp;lives.</p>
<h2><a name="bookmark137"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark138"></a>6. Super Brainwaves</span></h2>
<p class="font7">Super brainwaves are special waves because their speed is unlimited and their transmission can‘t be prevented by any materials or objects in the universe. In the past and present, God and the&nbsp;angels used super brainwaves to connect with and control human brains. However, humans&nbsp;cannot possess this technology before God liberates us. If we possess this technology too early,&nbsp;man will read others thoughts and control their wishes, which will disorder God‘s divine plan.</p>
<p class="font7">Super brainwaves play an important role in maintaining human immortal lives in the future. As we know, only the soul is immortal, physical bodies cannot survive forever. Therefore, after the&nbsp;final judgment day, God will grant us final knowledge about medicine and gene technology, etc.,&nbsp;which will man solve problems related to aging and disease. The new gene will offer man a&nbsp;perfect physical body and great longevity. However, only with new medicine knowledge and&nbsp;new gene structure, it‘s not enough for humans to live immortal lives.</p>
<p class="font7">When we are immortal, our souls will still connect with the central soul data based on super brainwaves on Earth. When our physical body gets old or deadly accidents destroy our bodies,&nbsp;we will use super brainwaves to install our souls (which have been saved in the central soul data)&nbsp;into a new body.</p>
<p class="font7">This future work is similar to what angels executed in the following cases:</p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font7">1. On July 19, 1985 a 17-year-old Indian girl named Sumitra died. When the family was&nbsp;preparing for her funeral, she suddenly came back to life and named herself Shira, and did&nbsp;not recognize anyone around her. This girl borrowed Sumitra‘s body to relive. Shira was a&nbsp;22-year-old woman who had died two months before. Her body was found on the train tracks&nbsp;with many wounds on her head. After Shira relived in Sumitra‘s body, she was taken back to&nbsp;Shira‘s family. Sumitra instantly recognized her relatives, friends, neighbors and individual&nbsp;belongings, and had the same handwriting style as Shira (whereas Sumitra had been&nbsp;illiterate).</p></li><li>
<p class="font7">2. At Tan Viet village, CaMau (Bat lagoon) Vietnam, Mr. Hieu‘s daughter died at 19 years&nbsp;of age. At the same time, at Vinh My village, there was a girl who died of illness. The family&nbsp;prepared for the funeral and burial, but suddenly, after one day she came back to life, healthy,&nbsp;as if she had never been sick. After she came back to life, she asked to be taken to Mr. Hieu‘s&nbsp;house. Thinking that their daughter was not normal, the family refused her many times, but&nbsp;finally the father took her to Mr. Hieu‘ s house. She described the village, the road to the&nbsp;house and details of Mr.Hieu‘s relatives. When she arrived, she recognized Mr. and Mrs.&nbsp;Hieu as her parents and she told them many secrets that only they knew.</p></li></ul>
<p class="font7">In these two cases, angels moved souls and possessed bodies. In the future, man will use super brainwaves to move souls from one body to another to maintain immortal life.</p>
<h2><a name="bookmark139"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark140"></a>7. Biological Robots</span></h2>
<p class="font7">Recently, humans have created many generations of robots, which serve in various industries, including manufacturing, discoveries, services, etc. However, our robot generations can‘t be&nbsp;compared to God‘s and the angels‘ robots, because their robot generations are much more&nbsp;advanced biological robots.</p>
<p class="font7">In reality, angels seldom manipulate flying saucers directly; instead, biological robots perform most tasks when they come to Earth. Biological robots have oversized heads in order to contain&nbsp;data and handle brains which function at high speed. They also have big eyes to see further and&nbsp;more clearly, and very big ears to hear clearly. The body structure and intellectual operations of&nbsp;biological robots is similar to humans, but these robots are not equipped with spiritual software&nbsp;programs.</p>
<p class="font7">After humans become masters of super brainwave techniques, we will create a biological robot generation by manipulating human genes and agamic cloning, just as God has. When creating the&nbsp;clone bodies, we will use super brainwaves to install into their brains a consciousness software&nbsp;program, as well as knowledge in one or more professional fields. In this way, we will&nbsp;manufacture biological robots.</p>
<p class="font7">These robots will be better than meant specific tasks. Biological robots can learn, supplement knowledge and work as normal humans, but they do not have desires, greed, sadness or anger.&nbsp;They just work as humans assign them. If the bodies of biological robots get old or damaged by&nbsp;accidents, we will collect the data in their brains. Then, we will reinstall this information in other&nbsp;clone bodies, helping them to live and continue working normally.</p>
<p class="font7">Nowadays, scientists have successfully cloned different kinds of animals. As presented in chapter two, all species on Earth that have intellect and sentiment also have hereditary genes.&nbsp;Therefore, when cloning is successful, the new version can live normally, as if it was born by&nbsp;parents. But this technology will be not applied to humans, because cloned bodies do not have&nbsp;intellect and sentiment. This will only be possible when we possess super brainwaves technology&nbsp;with which to install souls into those cloned bodies.</p>
<h2><a name="bookmark141"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark142"></a>8. Travel Through Space</span></h2>
<p class="font7">We are very proud because of the scientific technology and success humans have achieved in recent centuries. Particularly, we have made great advances in the universal space field. Five&nbsp;centuries ago, people thought that Earth was a fixed planet, yet in the 20th century humans&nbsp;conquered the moon. With current universal technology, we can only conquer planets in our&nbsp;solar system. However, when humans can progress and manufacture flying saucers, we will be&nbsp;capable of traveling to planets further than millions of light years away, and even galaxies that&nbsp;are billions of light years away from Earth. Our flying saucers will reach the speed as light&nbsp;speed; after all, man cannot sit inside flying saucers for billions of years just to visit those distant&nbsp;planets. Flying saucers today can‘t exceed light speed because they still needed to be&nbsp;manufactured with materials, and our materials can‘t exceed the speed of light.</p>
<p class="font7">In the future, when humanity will be liberated, we will join the members of highly evolved societies that are under God‘s control. At that time, we will be able to move to other member&nbsp;planets to visit, and even travel by super brainwave. The way humans travel through the universe&nbsp;will be similar to the way God allows souls to reincarnate, or the way Jesus Christ descended&nbsp;2000 years.</p>
<p class="font7">Before man travels to any other member planets, we should contact the aliens living there so that they can prepare necessary numbers of clone bodies. Later, we will use super brainwaves to&nbsp;install our souls into these clone bodies, and will be able to operate normally, just as if we were&nbsp;living on Earth. And when returning to Earth, humans use the same manner of transport.</p>
<p class="font7">In summary, super brainwave techniques will guarantee immortality and a perfectly convenient lifestyle for everyone on Earth. To achieve higher levels of evolution, we need God‘s and&nbsp;Angels‘ help in improving our knowledge so that everyone on Earth can have an immortal body&nbsp;and enjoys a convenient life. In the future, we will need God and the angels‘ help to improve our&nbsp;knowledge. In fact, science is the only way to HEAVEN.</p>

<h1><a name="bookmark144"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark145"></a>CONCLUSION</span></h1>
<p><a name="bookmark146"></a><span class="font7">Our God is a man of science; all of the invention/creation He has done for us are based on advanced scientific knowledge and superior technology. His works also need time and the&nbsp;appropriate process to reach success—not just by words alone. In our everyday life, we see&nbsp;events and phenomena occurring that are beyond our understanding. It’s because our level of&nbsp;intellect has not yet reached a required threshold needed for a scientific explanation. Thus we&nbsp;divinize the issue and name it mysterious. Besides, our God has a very compassionate heart and&nbsp;extreme patience with His divine plan. God created humans and guided us to the perfect life.</span></p>
<p class="font7">The Heaven that humanity has been seeking is nowhere else but right here on Earth. The process to acquire Heaven is based on our individual contribution and we each will be part of that&nbsp;immortal and perfect life. Thus from now on, we, despite genders, religions, nations or race,&nbsp;must cooperate and help each other to evolve together. Each of us needs to self-improve, morally&nbsp;as well as intellectually, to contribute all our ability and passion to the community for the overall&nbsp;purpose of human evolution.</p>
<p><a name="bookmark147"></a><span class="font7">The physical and material resources that God created/invented on Earth are abundant for everyone to have the most convenient life, for the present and in the future. We don’t necessarily&nbsp;need to fight to claim our own properties. We can’t carry material wealth with us after we die;&nbsp;we can only pass on morality and intellect to next our lives and thereby forever own it. Morality&nbsp;and intellect are truly valuable for us today, in our next lives, and for immortal life after&nbsp;salvation. Moreover, we can collectively contribute these values to the salvation of humanity and&nbsp;become </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">legitimately liberated citizens of the universe</span><span class="font7">.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark148"></a>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</span></h1>
<p class="font7">You and I have spent a lot of time together on this long journey. Finally, we know where humans came from, why we are here, and where we are destined to be. What matter the most is that we&nbsp;are aware of God‘s great and extremely important role in human life and our future. God not&nbsp;only prepared everything for us from the beginning, but He also had followed us each step of the&nbsp;way, guiding our evolution day after day. Moreover, God prepared for us a wonderful life, which&nbsp;we will enjoy with Him in immortal life.</p>
<p class="font7">With all that God has given us, we can‘t help but express endless gratitude and an utmost faithful respect for Him. In my mind, I absolutely believe that God will give everyone, myself included,&nbsp;a beautiful future. However, in order to achieve this strong belief, which equipped me to write&nbsp;this book, it has taken me 30 years of experiences and contemplation, which has enabled me to&nbsp;recognize these truths.</p>
<p class="font7">I was born to a poor family in a village in Quang Ngai Province in Vietnam. My family had six children; I am the fourth boy and have two younger sisters. When I was five years old, my dad&nbsp;was killed in the war, leaving my family to rely on the help of my relatives. Even with their help,&nbsp;life was still difficult. We each had to work very hard to just barely make ends meet. At the end&nbsp;of the war, my dad was honored as a patriotic martyr, which led me to be recruited by the&nbsp;government to become a sailor on commercial trade ships. Later on, during business trips to Da&nbsp;Nang, I met a girl and married her.</p>
<p class="font7">In 1982, as we were nearing the delivery date of our first child, my company temporarily cut my active duty, putting me on reserve and reducing my salary by a large portion. My wife and I ran&nbsp;into financial difficulty. In order to cope, I decided to go back to my hometown and asked some&nbsp;friends to join me in the practice of mediumship for lottery numbers so that I could win money to&nbsp;cover the costs associating with having a baby.</p>
<p class="font7">I would like to explain that, during those years, mediumship-the practice of channeling communication between spirits of the dead or deities and other humans-for the purpose of&nbsp;uncovering winning lottery numbers, was very popular in my hometown. There were quite a few&nbsp;people who participated in mediumship and won money to buy houses and motorbikes. The&nbsp;lottery was drawn every evening.</p>
<p class="font7">When we conducted mediumship for the first time, a local deity of Hoang Citadel channeled and gave us the number 15. That evening, the winning number came out to be exactly 15, but we had&nbsp;lacked the faith to bet much money, and so did not win much. However, though we only won a&nbsp;little, we were very excited and totally believed in this method. We decided to bet more next&nbsp;time.</p>
<p class="font7">Unfortunately, our next experiences did not turn out the way we hoped they would. We were given number 28, and the winning number was 29. Number 42 turned out to be 41, number 60&nbsp;turned out to be 06, and number 35 turned out as 15. After a number of losses, we did not have&nbsp;much money left, but we all realized that the numbers given to us were very close to the winning&nbsp;numbers. We thought that maybe we were not devout enough and decided to prepare better&nbsp;offerings to the deity for one last mediumship. We hoped this extra devotion would cause them&nbsp;to give us the winning numbers, allowing us to get back what we had lost. This time a deity&nbsp;named —Monkey King” channeled and gave us number 43. He promised that it was the precise&nbsp;number— there was no need to reverse, add, subtract, multiply, or divide. Sure enough, the&nbsp;winning number was 43, just as promised, but it came one day after we bet on it.</p>
<p class="font7">Hopeless and angry, we decided to conduct another mediumship for the Monkey King to ask the reason for this delay. As requested, the Monkey King channeled and said that there were&nbsp;unexpected problems that had led to the confusion. Then, to make up for the loss, he gave us&nbsp;number 67. We trusted him again, and bet on number 67. Once more, we lost. It was similar to&nbsp;the previous time; the number was accurate, but it came out one day after we bet. A few days&nbsp;later, unsettled by the treatment of the deity, we conducted mediumship again with the intent to&nbsp;ask for the cause; we had lost our desire to ask for winning numbers. The deity Monkey King&nbsp;channeled, did not seem interested in explaining, but simply said that if we trusted him, we&nbsp;should bet number 99 and we would get back what we had lost. However, we just couldn‘t trust&nbsp;him after all these times, and most of us were out of money. Those who still had some money&nbsp;decided to wait until the next day. Ironically, that evening‘s winning numbers came out to&nbsp;precisely 99. At this point, I decided that since the number 99 is the last of all two-digit integers,&nbsp;this was an omen from the deity telling us to stop betting.</p>
<p class="font7">Sadly, our intent to earn money by mediumship was over and I was in great debt. I sold everything valuable in my house. I hated God, Earth, and the deities who had deceived and&nbsp;mistreated me. They not only had refused my pleas for help in getting money to pay for baby‘s&nbsp;delivery, but they also brought additional adversity on me and my family.</p>
<p class="font7">From that moment on, I was determined to find the truth about deities, ghost phenomena, and the cause of my failure in mediumship. I thought my failure was due to bad fate. Good fortune had&nbsp;not come to me, but I had persisted in trying to find it, and had been punished for my greed. I&nbsp;related to the following story: a poor man came to a rich person to ask for help. The rich person&nbsp;gave him some money; though it was not much, it was enough for the poor man to overcome&nbsp;adversity. After a few requests, the poor man decided that it was easy to keep asking him for&nbsp;money, so he kept returning to the rich person for help. Finally, the rich person got angry at the&nbsp;poor man. He not only stopped helping, but also told his servants to beat the poor man badly.</p>
<p class="font7">When studying the phenomenon of deities, a saying from Buddhism resonated with me: —Form does not differ from Emptiness and Emptiness does not differ from Form.” This helped me to&nbsp;theorize about the nature of deities. There must be a reason for everything that happens, and once&nbsp;it happens, we cannot say it did not. Therefore, existence must exist, and non-existence must not&nbsp;exist. I thought the events that my friends and I had experienced relating to the deities were real.&nbsp;Thus, deities must exist and are as real as humans. I concluded that the deities conduct their acts&nbsp;using superior signal wave technology and wireless energy that we are unable to see. In addition,&nbsp;the deities operate technological equipment from far-away locations, making it even more&nbsp;difficult for us to see. No wonder people often mistakenly think deities are invisible.</p>
<p class="font7">According to these deductions, I determined that the deities knew in advance the winning numbers, but that they had given us wrong numbers because our fortunes were not yet fated to&nbsp;come. Moreover, they had intentionally given us slightly wrong numbers, so that we would&nbsp;believe in their power and continue our pursuit and lose, fitting the bad fate assigned to us at that&nbsp;moment. Later, I wondered how they knew the winning numbers that had not yet been drawn,&nbsp;and how they also knew the actions that we were about to carry out. I concluded that they either&nbsp;caused these events to happen or interfered somehow. That was the only way they could have&nbsp;known these things in advance; if they did not make them happen nor interfere with these events,&nbsp;they would not know.</p>
<p class="font7">I also concluded that deities are extraterrestrial beings (aliens) with real physical bodies, and that God is their leader. That was all I knew at that moment, but these initial ideas later helped me&nbsp;continue studying mysteries and matters related to God and humans.</p>
<p class="font7">After a while, I developed additional viewpoints relating to these matters, but constant contemplation made me very tense. One day, my mind suddenly became very unstable,&nbsp;alternating between unconsciousness and awareness. I lost my appetite and was unable to sleep&nbsp;for many days, wandering everywhere in my town like a crazy man. This event lasted for two&nbsp;months before the stability of my mind returned, without any treatment. I found that I was even&nbsp;more alert than before. One day in May 1983 after my mind had returned to normal, I heard a&nbsp;very strong voice in my head while riding a bus from Quang Ngai to Da Nang. The words it&nbsp;spoke were,</p>
<p class="font7">“<span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">De tu nghe day Ta la Thai 'Hmong Tien Ong Thanh The Ngoc Hoang Tliuo'ng De, ta den de bao cho con biet: con la nguoi dau tien tren the gian&nbsp;nay tim thay Ta. </span><span class="font7">(Listen to me, my disciple. I am the Supreme Power, the First&nbsp;Deity, the Sacred Body, the Holy King, and the Only God; I have come to let you&nbsp;know that you are the first person in this world to find me)”</span></p>
<p class="font7">The voice was as strong and terrifying as thunder, and made me very nervous. Later on, that voice appeared in my head many times, but after awhile it spoke more gently. I gradually became&nbsp;more familiar with God‘s voice and could communicate with Him using my own inner voice. If I&nbsp;wanted to pray to God for something, I prayed with my inner voice. God listened and responded.&nbsp;Most of the time, God‘s voice suddenly appeared in my head and spoke continuously until the&nbsp;end of a revelation. In addition, He later channeled through me by way of mediumship so my&nbsp;family could also listen to His words. While I was being channeled, the messages I received&nbsp;turned into my spoken words. My consciousness and thinking could not interfere with the words&nbsp;that came out of my mouth. I heard those words as if I were listening to someone else speaking,&nbsp;and I could perceive those words as those nearby did. Aside from the times I intended to pray to&nbsp;God for help, He also commanded that at the beginning of every lunar month, my family should&nbsp;gather together so He could give us guidance.</p>
<p class="font7">One time, God channeled and promised me that I would have immortal life and enjoy a happy life in heaven. My life at that time was miserable and I was often broke, so I asked God for help.&nbsp;But He just said, —You must experience adversity because of a reason that you will understand in&nbsp;the near future. But, your hardship will be made up for in future worth.” In general, when I&nbsp;prayed for money, He refused.</p>
<p class="font7">Once, just before my ancestors‘ death anniversary, I was totally out of money, so I prayed to God, asking for a winning lottery number so I could win money to buy offerings for my&nbsp;ancestors. God channeled and commanded, —Listen to me, my disciple. I am the Supreme Power,&nbsp;the First Deity, the Sacred Body, the Holy King, and the Only God. Today I come to you not due&nbsp;to your entreaties regarding your ancestors‘ death anniversary, but because tomorrow is your&nbsp;birthday. I give you number 95 as a small gift, but you are allowed to bet only 10,000 dong&nbsp;(about $2).” In fact, my ancestor's death anniversary was also my birthday, but my life was so&nbsp;miserable that I had forgotten it, and God reminded me. After God left, I realized that this was&nbsp;the first time that God had helped me, so if I bet more than 10,000 dong, I thought He would not&nbsp;mind. I borrowed money to bet 100,000 dong (about $20) for number 95. In the evening, when&nbsp;the winning number came out to be 95, I checked the lottery receipt. It turned out that the bet&nbsp;amount was written down for only 10,000 dong, the number God had advised me to bet. Having&nbsp;no grounds to argue the point with the broker, I accepted the amount for the 10,000 dong bet,&nbsp;which was 700,000 dong (about $140). After this event, I knew that God had indirectly reminded&nbsp;me that I needed to study more into the mysterious aspects of the human soul, as well as the&nbsp;souls of my ancestors and grandparents. In addition, this made me believe that God and the&nbsp;angels can interfere with the thoughts and actions of humans. Apparently, God had not changed&nbsp;my initial thoughts and actions. He instead controlled the broker, causing him to write the wrong&nbsp;amount and me not to check the receipt, so that everything happened exactly as He wished.&nbsp;Later, I realized that ‘95 was also the year I lost my job.</p>
<p class="font7">God helped me many times, and each time I developed new viewpoints, all of which became ideas for the book. A few of these instances are as follows:</p>
<p class="font7">At the end of 1989, as the people around us were excitedly preparing for Tet holidays (Vietnamese New Year), my family was desperately in need-we had no house and no motorbike.&nbsp;I had to take my wife and kids back to my hometown for the Tet holidays. During New Year‘s&nbsp;Eve, God channeled and said, —Listen to me, my disciples. I am the Supreme Power, the First&nbsp;Deity, the Sacred Body, the Holy King, and the Only God, I have come to let you know that this&nbsp;year you will buy a house. Moreover, your life will be much better and prosperous.”</p>
<p class="font7">Honestly, after I heard what God said, I only hoped that God would help me win the lottery in order to buy a house, because at that time I was about to get laid off and there was no other hope&nbsp;for money. But things happened in ways I could never have imagined. On the 5th day of the&nbsp;lunar year, I reunited with my blood brother, who worked at the same company, but whom I&nbsp;hadn‘t seen for a long time. He knew the chief executives personally and sponsored me to work&nbsp;as an active sailor again, as well as loaned me money for my business. My business boomed&nbsp;quickly and I earned great profits. As a result, that April I bought a house, and by the end of the&nbsp;year I had quite a bit of money in savings. This event helped me recognize that every individual&nbsp;has a unique fate route which includes predetermined periods of fortunes and adversities.</p>
<p class="font7">When our fate is bad for certain periods of time, most of our efforts to change it are useless. Conversely, when our fate is favorable, we will run into affairs that lead us to success. When our&nbsp;fate is bad, even if we pray hard or offer great gifts to the deities, angels will not help us; the&nbsp;more we pray, the more ignorant we become. When good fate comes around, however, angels&nbsp;will help us quietly and without any conditions so that we can obtain success.</p>
<p class="font7">When my wife got pregnant with our third child, I hoped I would have a son, because I already had two daughters. I was anxious to know whether it was a girl or a boy, but at that time we&nbsp;didn’t have ultrasound tests to know beforehand. I prayed to God so He would tell me. God&nbsp;channeled and revealed to me that the fetus was a boy, and He also told me the exact time and&nbsp;day the child would be born. Sure enough, my son was born at the time and day that God had&nbsp;revealed. Then, when naming my son, He revealed that I should name him Ngoc Hoang—king of&nbsp;heaven—in honor of Him.</p>
<p class="font7">After this, I came to believe that God and the angels know clearly about the structure and operation of human bodies, and, moreover, that they can control the biological operations in our&nbsp;bodies from far distances if they so desire. This made me think of people who, while conducting&nbsp;mediumship, have the ability to treat patients with pure water or leaves. What really happens is&nbsp;that the angels treat patients with superior technological equipment from outside of Earth, and&nbsp;the water or leaves are just a way to hide their work.</p>
<p class="font7">On the first day of the lunar year in 1992, God channeled and said, —Listen to me, my disciple. I am the Supreme Power, the First Deity, the Sacred Body, the Holy King, and the Only God.&nbsp;Today is the first day of the New Year, so I have come here to celebrate with all of you.” Then&nbsp;He kept silent and wept much. His emotion passed through me and made me cry heavily. Before&nbsp;leaving, He said one more thing, —But everything will be fine. I shall leave now.” In March of&nbsp;that year, when I was driving my wife and my three-year-old son on a motorbike back to my&nbsp;hometown for an ancestors’ remembrance event, we had a terrible accident. I was seriously&nbsp;injured and nearly died. My wife had minor scratches, but my son was completely intact. A day&nbsp;after that, my son said that he saw a long arm holding him up while he was falling during the&nbsp;accident. From this, I inferred that God is very merciful. Though He had pity for me when He&nbsp;knew the angels would implement my fate with this terrible accident, but He could not help me&nbsp;avoid it or warn me in advance. Doing so would have ruined the route of fate.</p>
<p class="font7">I learned that in order to execute the route of fate for humans, angels make some people get into accidents, and simultaneously help others survive them, by means that appear very natural. In&nbsp;fact, these occurrences are carried out through their superior technological equipment. This&nbsp;applies in my son’s case. At the moment of the accident, angels helped my son by using some&nbsp;type of anti-gravity waves that prevented him from falling hard on the ground. Simultaneously,&nbsp;they installed an image file into his brain so that he saw a long arm from the sky lifting him&nbsp;gently. What he saw was not actually a physical arm, but a projection in his own mind. We know&nbsp;that in life there are many tragic accidents that cause fatalities. However, some people in those&nbsp;accidents survive surprisingly unharmed; we call these instances miracles. In fact, these&nbsp;occasions are not incidental. They are due to the help of angels, who conduct their actions in&nbsp;subtle ways so we don’t recognize them and assume that these miracles are just pure luck.</p>
<p class="font7">In 1995, after I quit my job, I intended to go to Daklak to buy 10 acres of land for coffee farming. I had prepared everything for the trip and just before heading out, my wife and I prayed&nbsp;to God for advice. He channeled and said, —Tien di thi co, tien ve thi khong (Though you leave&nbsp;with much money, when you come back you will not have any money left).” We listened to His&nbsp;advice and gave up our plan. As it turned out, one year after that there was a drought. The coffee&nbsp;farm I had intended to buy had a severe lack of water. Moreover, coffee prices dropped&nbsp;significantly. Some people even cut down coffee to plant other food crops.</p>
<p class="font7">After that event, I concluded that God and the angels know thoroughly about the structure of the earth, the atmosphere, and the laws of weather. They know what will happen many years in&nbsp;advance. Through that same line of reasoning, I realized that prophets, such as the deity who&nbsp;gave me the numbers, can foretell earthquakes and catastrophes because they have received&nbsp;messages from those who know things in advance and will cause them to happen.</p>
<p class="font7">In August 1989, when I was driving and my mind was occupied with plans to earn a living, I suddenly received a revelation from God in one short phrase, —That bat, bai tan (No more loss,&nbsp;failure is defeated).” I did not have a chance to react before He finished his words and left. I&nbsp;thought a lot about this message, and at that time I thought He was referring to my business&nbsp;affairs. But when I did not see immediate business success, I decided this was not what He had&nbsp;meant, and then forgot about them. It was not until 2011, when I started to write the book, that&nbsp;He appeared and revealed this phrase again as a reminder, so that I could understand its real&nbsp;meaning, as well as apply it in the arrangement of the puzzle pieces and solve the puzzle. My&nbsp;solution to the puzzle, so to speak, is presented in this book.</p>
<p class="font7">I would like to tell you more about my family life. In addition to working as a sailor until 1995, my wife and I ran many other businesses on the side, such as a restaurant, a bread bakery, an ice&nbsp;cream store, a real estate business, seafood growing, a motorbike trade shop, a coffee bar and&nbsp;football brokering. All of these business ventures came up short, so we left Da Nang and moved&nbsp;to Ho Chi Minh to find new opportunities. That was also God‘s wish, I later realized. I was not&nbsp;able to find a job and therefore had plenty of free time. I made friends with my old computer day&nbsp;in and day out, killing time by reading news and playing chess online. After a while, I got the&nbsp;idea to write a book to tell the world about my findings and experiences over the years.</p>
<p class="font7">At the beginning, I thought the viewpoints that I intended to share in the book were quite new and inflammatory. We prayed to God for ideas. He channeled and said, —Listen to me, my&nbsp;disciple. I am the Supreme Power, the First Deity, the Sacred Body, the Holy King, and the Only&nbsp;God. Today, I have come to tell you that your life has followed the route I chose for you&nbsp;beforehand. Your intention to write this book is also my wish. It is time for you to fulfill the&nbsp;noble mission of writing the book and announcing it to the whole world. However, this moment&nbsp;is not the right time to start. You have to do research using documents, literature, and news&nbsp;related to the book, including religious scriptures. When appropriate, I will determine the date&nbsp;for you start to write.” I obeyed His words and studied evolutionary theory, intelligent design&nbsp;theory, the big bang theory, human history, the Old and New Testaments of the Bible, the&nbsp;Qur‘an, Buddhist doctrines, Caodaism history, the Tao TeChing, and many other religious&nbsp;scriptures. I also read documents about spiritual phenomena, mysteries of ancient architecture,&nbsp;UFO, crop circles, and other unexplained phenomena.</p>
<p class="font7">After studying for a while, even though I had learned a lot, I still did not have enough confidence in my ability to write this book, because I had not written anything of length in my life. I prayed&nbsp;to God to ask Him to reveal it to me word by word and phrase by phrase, like He did for&nbsp;Muhammad, the prophet and the author of the Qur‘an. My prayer was heard by God, and on an&nbsp;evening in lunar March 2011, He appeared and said, —I am your Master and also your Lord. Your&nbsp;wish cannot be fulfilled because of two reasons:</p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">First, your case is not the same as Muhammad the prophet. He was chosen beforehand to&nbsp;fulfill a mission. Moreover, he is also the last person who will work for Me in that way. You&nbsp;are different. If I tell you word by word what to write, all of your effort since the beginning&nbsp;will be rendered meaningless. In addition, if I reveal to you word by word, you would not&nbsp;completely understand the meaning of what you write. You must understand and write your&nbsp;own words.</span></p></li><li>
<p class="font1">• &nbsp;<span class="font7">Second, the book will contain many truths that I did not intend to announce to humans. I&nbsp;gave humans many messages and expected someone to find me with the right understanding.&nbsp;I will acknowledge that person as my disciple and I will guide that person to write the book.&nbsp;You are the first to find me in that way. Therefore, you must write this book yourself. From&nbsp;this day on, you are not allowed to deny this responsibility. Your mission is to unravel what&nbsp;you found and complete the book. I promise, in the process of writing the book, I‘ll let my&nbsp;son Jesus Christ come to help you on my behalf.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p class="font7">On the afternoon of lunar June 1, 2011, God revealed to me, —Tonight, everyone in your family needs to be present for my guidance.” That night, once everyone gathered together, God&nbsp;channeled and commanded, —I am the Supreme Power, the First Deity, the Sacred Body, the&nbsp;Holy King and the Only God. Today I have come to tell you that, besides my first disciple, I will&nbsp;acknowledge 12 more disciples: the wife of the first disciple, the eldest daughter and her&nbsp;husband, the second daughter and her husband, the son, the granddaughter, and cousin of the first&nbsp;disciple, Nguyen Thanh Phong. The rest I will declare later. All of you have duties to help the&nbsp;first disciple fulfill the mission I have assigned him. You must do these things in order to&nbsp;accumulate merit for yourselves. As for the book, it is unnecessary to register it for copyright, as&nbsp;it will not be for profit. You only need to create a website and upload the content to share with&nbsp;everyone in the world.”</p>
<p class="font7">On lunar July 1, 2011, God channeled and informed me that I could start writing on lunar July 6 (August 5th 2011). He advised that I should write daily from 10 PM to 2 AM, except Sundays, in&nbsp;order to work most efficiently. He also said that I would have to write three times to be&nbsp;successful. Sure enough, everything He said happened exactly as we were told.</p>
<p class="font7">As scheduled, at 10 PM on lunar July 6, I started writing the first draft. I finished the book in a little more than a month. After typing and reading it again, I recognized that I had written poorly,&nbsp;and that many viewpoints were not clearly explained. During this time, I had a dream that I was&nbsp;looking at a new building. I entered the building and saw that most of the interior was in a state&nbsp;of disorder. When I woke up, I knew that this was a message from God to let me know my&nbsp;writing was not good. I trashed it and carefully started writing again from the beginning. Four&nbsp;months later, I finished the second draft. While rereading it, I realized that some viewpoints were&nbsp;still not completely reasonable, and that there were shortcomings. My writing was still very&nbsp;rough. Thus, I decided to start writing for the third time. During the time that I was writing the&nbsp;third draft of the book, I was helped by Jesus Christ many times, as God foretold.</p>
<p class="font7">When writing about the origin of the universe, I applied Christian viewpoints and cited biblical words to form arguments that God created the universe. I was afraid to offend the faith traditions&nbsp;of many people. I could not sleep the night after I wrote these viewpoints, nor the night after that.&nbsp;My mind was stuck on the problem and I could not solve it. At 5 AM on the third night, God&nbsp;channeled and said, —I am your Master. I want you to spread your knowledge to all of&nbsp;humankind. However, you must first understand everything by its true nature. I will accept that&nbsp;you cannot write well, but I will not accept when you are wrong, even in one small viewpoint.”&nbsp;About one minute later, Jesus Christ channeled (this was the first time I was contacted by Jesus&nbsp;Christ through revelation). He said, —I am your Jesus Christ. On behalf of my Father, I have&nbsp;come to ask you a question. ‘Do you think life could have existed before the universe was&nbsp;formed, or not?‘” I was quite stunned in this quiet space. He continued, —Think about it and find&nbsp;the most reasonable answer yourself.” Jesus Christ‘s words helped me determine my viewpoints&nbsp;about the formation of the universe (as presented in chapter 2). After that, I had a peaceful sleep.</p>
<p class="font7">When writing about issues related to human origin, I initially did not think that humans evolved from chimpanzees, as theorized by Charles Robert Darwin. I thought God commanded the angels&nbsp;to use their genetic codes to make humans. However, after writing this down, the sleeping&nbsp;problem happened again. The first night, I could not sleep and I knew I was wrong. But due to&nbsp;my preconceptions, even after contemplating for a long time, I couldn‘t figure out why I was&nbsp;wrong. On the third night, Jesus Christ appeared and said, —I am your Jesus Christ. I have come&nbsp;to ask you if, in your opinion, there is any difference between my gene structure and human gene&nbsp;structure?” He continued, —You should know that evolution is a necessary process for all&nbsp;development.” With Jesus‘ guidance, I was able to develop correct viewpoints about the origin&nbsp;and evolution of humans as presented in chapter 2.</p>
<p class="font7">When mentioning religion, I asserted that Buddhist monks‘ practices were passive, and not good for overall human development. Again, I was unable to sleep. I knew that I was wrong, but due&nbsp;to a strong prejudice I did not know why.</p>
<p class="font7">My prejudice came from events I had witnessed. When I was young, my mom worked far away from home and my brothers and I lived with our grandma. My grandma was 75 years old and&nbsp;had defects on her legs and back pain, making it hard for her to move around. Nevertheless,&nbsp;whether sunny or rainy, my grandma had to go trading vegetables in the market to feed us. There&nbsp;were many monks walking around the town to collect alms, and I often saw my grandma bring&nbsp;them food or give them money. Sometimes I was upset with her for sharing our resources, but&nbsp;she explained that she carried out good deeds to accumulate merits for us. Despite that, I still&nbsp;thought the monks were not good people because they were younger and healthier than my&nbsp;grandma, but instead of working to earn a living, they just waited for people like my grandma to&nbsp;supply them with goods for their religious practice. No matter what people said, my attitude&nbsp;toward monks was difficult to change, because what I had witnessed was engraved in my mind.</p>
<p class="font7">Similar to previous times, on the third night, Jesus Christ appeared and asked me, —In your opinion, in the present and future, what is most valuable to humans?” And then He said, —You&nbsp;know the parable of the speck from the New Testament, correct? Before removing the speck&nbsp;from your brother's eye, you first need to take the plank out of your own eye. Do not judge, or&nbsp;you too will be judged. Moreover, you should know that all knowledge that my Father brought to&nbsp;humans is beneficial.” (The parable of the speck and the log is in the New Testament, in Mathew&nbsp;7:1-5.) With Jesus Christ’s advice, I recognized that the human soul is the most valuable. An&nbsp;important part of the soul is the spirit, and the spirit creates human personality. The nature of&nbsp;human personality is very difficult to change. Thus, God revealed Buddhism to help humans&nbsp;cultivate their spirit. To become a true Buddhist, one may have to spend several lives practicing&nbsp;renunciation. When these souls reach a certain stage, God will reincarnate them into more&nbsp;advantageous families to have the opportunity to acquire knowledge and later become much&nbsp;more beneficial to society. With the foundation of morality and compassion available in the&nbsp;RPLI (Repository of Previous Lives’ Information), no matter where they work, they will put the&nbsp;interests of everyone else above their own.</p>
<p class="font7">I came to recognize that everything God does has meaning. Buddhism has its good aspects, Christianity has its good aspects, and so does Islam. All religions have good things, and all the&nbsp;things that God has brought to humans have given value in each developmental era. Some have&nbsp;timeless value, while others are only valuable and appropriate at one point in time.</p>
<p class="font7">In addition the occurrences mentioned above, God and Jesus Christ also sent me messages in my dreams that helped me complete this book.</p>
<p class="font7">In fact, while I was writing this book, I did not intend to write about my personal life. This intention changed when I had almost finished the book. On Christmas Eve 2011, which is the&nbsp;first day of lunar December 2011, my family and I prayed to God for guidance, as usual. But this&nbsp;time, God did not appear. Instead, Jesus Christ appeared. This was the first time Jesus Christ&nbsp;came to us by mediumship (on previous times, He revealed to me through the voice in my head).&nbsp;He channeled and commanded, —I am your Jesus Christ. Tonight, all over the world people are&nbsp;singing and honoring my birth, but in reality I was never born on Earth. I actually came to Earth&nbsp;per my Father’s wishes in the body of a man called Jesus at the baptism ceremony on the Jordan&nbsp;River. But today I have come here not for that, I have another important thing of which to inform&nbsp;you. In the final chapter of the book, the first disciple has to tell everything that happened in his&nbsp;life and things related to my Father and Me, so that all people in the world will know. This is the&nbsp;wish of my Father, who is your Master. Thus, the first disciple must take it seriously and make it&nbsp;happen. I am leaving now.”</p>
<p class="font7">On New Year’s Eve of the Dragon (2012), all of my family members and I gathered together to pray for God’s guidance. God channeled and said, —I am the Supreme Power, the First Deity, the&nbsp;Sacred Body, the Holy King, and the Only God. Today, I have come to let my disciples know&nbsp;that this year is very important for the whole world. It is a developmental turning point for&nbsp;humankind, and it is also an important year for all of you. Today, I am letting you know that on&nbsp;lunar July 17 (Sept 2, 2012) you must have the website officially go live. You have to try your&nbsp;best to fulfill this mission to accumulate merits, and I will soon bring you many great things. I go&nbsp;now.” After God had gone, Jesus Christ channeled. He said, —From now on, you need to reclaim&nbsp;your virtue, strengthen your faith in God, and serve Him with your heart. In the near future, God&nbsp;will reward you with many great things. The best way to serve at the moment is to complete all&nbsp;of the tasks related to the book and to spread this ideology to all people in the world. This will&nbsp;help humans speed up the evolutionary process and shorten the time to the final judgment day.”&nbsp;In addition, He advised that my children should only edit my writing style, not the viewpoints in&nbsp;the book, because they are already correct.</p>
<p class="font7">More than a month before the website went into operation, while my son-in-law (who is also a disciple of God) and I edited the book section about the appearance of God and the angels, we&nbsp;were stuck. We did not know whether God and the angels first existed at the same time, or if&nbsp;God appeared before the angels. For this reason, we decided not to mention this issue in the&nbsp;book. But God channeled and said, —I am the Supreme Power, the First Deity, the Sacred Body,&nbsp;the Holy King, and the Only God. I always follow your thoughts and actions. I can come to&nbsp;convey information to the first disciple at any time, in any form, and anywhere—you do not&nbsp;always need to pray for me to come. I have come to tell you that I was the first presence in the&nbsp;universe and that I created the angels. I go now.” After God left, we wrote this fact into the book.</p>
<p class="font7">Five days after the website launched, just before lunch, God revealed to me and said, —I am your Master. In addition to the issues you‘ve written about, I‘ll tell you another fact that you should&nbsp;speak out for everyone to know. I lived in the body of Lao Tzu for three years and I wrote the&nbsp;Tao TeChing. I left the remains of Lao Tzu in the desert before returning to Paradise.”</p>
<p class="font7">After all that I have experienced, I recognize that faith comes from our spirit. But if faith is not guided by the mind and knowledge, it will become blind. I was not following any religion when I&nbsp;experienced these things. After understanding and having found the truth, I have come to believe&nbsp;in God with certainty, though I am still not following any religion at the moment.</p>
<p class="font7">Finally, I want to express my deep gratitude to my beloved wife, who has shared with me all my happiness and misery through the past 30 years, and who has supported me from the first day I&nbsp;began writing this book. Thanks to my son, daughter and son-in-law, cousin, Dr. Jed Jones,&nbsp;Author Ranee Spina, editor Matt R, editor Kelsey C has always supported me to edit, translate,&nbsp;and contributed many practical ideas for completing the book and the website.</p>
<p class="font7">I am so grateful to all of the readers who have shared with me in this story. The story is just the beginning for the viewpoints and visions that I have expressed in this book. In my opinion, these&nbsp;viewpoints and visions are very fundamental to our life, bringing a new understanding about the&nbsp;human origin, the value of religions, the ultimate meaning of life, and what future holds for&nbsp;humanity. Whether my viewpoints and visions are right or wrong, good or bad, whether they&nbsp;have significant values or they are just nonsensical, I urge you to read and judge them for&nbsp;yourself. I am very glad to hear your comments and suggestions.</p>
